# Alto files

## Synopsis

This repository contains some of the original files for the Xerox Alto, as well as some useful disk images. These are intended to used by the [palo](https://github.com/hsnaves/palo) project.

The majority of the files were obtained from the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/) at <https://xeroxalto.computerhistory.org/index.html>. According to the CHM website:
> The [Palo Alto Research Center](http://www.parc.com/) (a [Xerox](http://www.xerox.com/) company) has authorized the Computer History Museum to provide public viewing of the software, documents, and other files on this web site, and to provide these same files to private individuals and non-profit institutions with the same rights granted to CHM and subject to the same obligations undertaken by CHM.

Another important source of documentation for the Alto comes from the Al Kosow's Bitsavers Archive: <http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/alto/>.

## Organization

The Alto disk images can be found in the `disks` sub-folder, and the copy of the CHM files can be found in `chm` sub-folder. In addition, `microcode` contains the source code of the Alto microcode.

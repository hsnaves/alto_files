Error code is $1D.$$9 Too many Overlay Entry Points.  Increase numOEP in IfsOverlaysInit.$$10 CtxRunning attempted to set lock at $1O multiple times.$$11 CtxRunning does not own the lock at $1O.$$12 SnarfTable is screwed up.$$13 SnarfBuffer failed: no vMem buffers available.(Proceeding will wait a while and retry the Snarf)$$14 smallZone is empty.  Block size requested is $1D. words.(Proceeding will allocate the block from bigZone)$$15 bigZone is empty.  Block size requested is $1D. words.(Proceeding will cause a vMem buffer to be snarfed)$$16 LoadRam failed.

Run IFSScavenger.)$$37 InitFmap failed.$$40 There are two error strings with code $1D$$45 VMem: illegal virtual page$$46 VMem: illegal page type$$47 VMem: can't flush locked page$$48 VMem: lock list full$$50 Malformed XM overlay, probably caused by an assembly-languagemodule that doesn't follow the Bcpl "rules".$$51 An overlay is larger than 1K and would cross an XM bank boundary.Either reorder the overlays or reduce the oversize one.$$52 Overlay malfunction: faulted on overlay that is already present.$$53 Bad overlay call.$$54 FindOverlayFromPn failed.$$55 Too many XM Entry points.  Increase numXEP in IfsOverlaysInit.$$56 MakeFree called with negative length.$$60 The Control RAM is broken!  Address $1O was $2O $3O, should be $4O $5O.Run DMT or MadTest for further information.$$61 The S-registers don't work!

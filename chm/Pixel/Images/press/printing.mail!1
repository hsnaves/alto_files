Theold Press was simply assuming that the sync code would never get higherthan 10,000.  And largish VLSI plots produced by Icarus and by Chipmunkwere running afoul of this unstated and unchecked limit, causing rectanglesto drift down the page, sometimes getting lost and sometimes turning black.The new Press has upped the limit to 32,750 and is supposed to give youan error message (by falling into Swat) if you exceed this bound.  Withwork, it might be possible to raise the bound from 32K to 64K, but I'm notgoing to do this unless pushed (and maybe not even then).  Thus,producers of very large color VLSI check plots would be well advisedto output their rectangles in groups that are the same color, instead ofresetting the hue, saturation and brightness between every two rectangles.(Note that the latter approach involves three new sync codes per rectangle in the current implementation, not just one!)Press maintainers:  retrieve the new Press.run, Press.syms, AND Press.Errorsfrom [Maxc2]<Press>,Lyle*start*01751 00024 US Date: 30 March 1981 6:43 pm PST (Monday)From: Ramshaw.PASubject: Press 3.0 is releasedTo: Hunt, Dale.EOS, Warnock, Paeth.EOS, GWilliams, Starkweather, Geschke, OrrReply-To: Ramshawcc: RamshawPress 3.0 is now out on [Maxc2]<Press>;  just some more bug fixes and minorfeatures.  (I changed major versions from 2 to 3 just to give the illusion ofprogress.)  Changes:i) Bob Hunt contributed some fixes to the Versatec code for empty pages, andalso new things for his TC200 printer.ii) Glen Williams and I fixed the microcode bitmap rotator:  heaven only knowshow the old one ever worked, if it ever did.  (And we only used up one of thetwo free locations in the RAM...)iii) I offer you a NEW FEATURE (at the request of Bob Hunt), in particular,a new command line switch.  If you say "Press/L", then Press will determinewhat pixels a rule covers by a method that guarantees that all rules of thesame mica width (or height) will come out the same number of pixels wide(or high), regardless of where they are positioned on the page.   This propertyis valuable for printing SIL graphics on low resolution devices, for example.Unfortunately, any method of scan converting that has this property cannotalso have another critical property:  namely, that a page covered precisely onceby rules in mica-space will have each pixel covered exactly once as well.  Thus, Press/L will handle SIL graphics rather well, but will do horriblethings to John Warnock-style images built up out of lots of little Show-Dots.Conversely, the standard Press (without /L) will make John happy, but would make SIL graphics on low-resolution printers look worse.  Now youcan pay your money (to me?) and take your choice.Lyle*start*05384 00024 US Date: 1 April 1981 5:22 pm PST (Wednesday)From: Lansford.EOSSubject: PressingTo: Putman.PAcc: Hains, GWilliams.PA, VanOrden, LansfordFollowing is a summary of work done to make Puffin life easier.The idea was to build Press files with references to External Files, typicallycontaining high resolution scanned images.

(At least, it's interesting to me -- maybe you knew about it all along.) Our current BitBlt takes three parameters D(estination), S(ource), and P(attern),and assigns (pixel-by-pixel)	D _ func(D, S & P).P is of fixed size, is replicated as necessary to match the size of S, and is alignedin a particular way with D.  However, if one is working with objects of arbitraryshape, one would like to replace the P argument by a true mask which definedthe (filled) outline of the source shape.  Calling such an argument M, thedesired operation of BitBlt would be	D _ if M than func(D, S) else D,i.e. only change D at the points selected by M.  At present, one can fill arbitraryoutlines with a stipple pattern by letting S = the filled outline and P = thepattern, but one can't do operations with shapes defined by a non-rectangularoutline.It seems to me that the D-S-M specification is more useful than the presentD-S-P arrangement.  If you have D-S-M and want D-S-P, you can still fillrather large areas (rectangular or not) quickly with stipple patterns by repeatedcalls on BitBlt starting with a pattern of modest size (like the present 16 x 16); Idon't know whether other uses of the stipple pattern have turned out to beuseful, but I suspect not.  On the other hand, if you have D-S-P and want tosimulate D-S-M, you have to create an auxiliary bitmap A and do something like	A _ D.	A _ func(A, S).	A _ A & M.	D _ D & not M.	D _ D or A.If D-S-M is really better than D-S-P, it's too bad we didn't specify it that wayfor the release.  What do you all think?*start*02021 00024 US Date: 29 July 1981 10:40 am PDT (Wednesday)From: Ingalls.PASubject: Re: BitBlt specificationIn-reply-to: Your message of 28 July 1981 1:38 pm PDT (Tuesday)To: Deutschcc: LRG^, ISL^, Lyon, IngallsReply-To: IngallsThere are certainly some nice aspects to Dick's proposal, but I'm not bothered bythe spec that we put out.  I find it hard to evaluate the masking spec withouthaving to live with it.  The plusses and minusses which come to mind are:Plusses:1) This is certainly what one wants for animation.  However, all animation I'veplayed with has been amenable to implementation with 2 BLTs per image; thefirst does DEST & notMASK (mask being the hull of all solid colors), and thesecond does DEST or FIGURE.  Still, a factor of 2 is always nice.2) Another application of significance is cursors with opaque white (this isespecially nice when you work with solid blacks.  This falls in the same 2-BLTcategory as animation above.  Speed can be important here to avoid flicker bydoing it during retrace.Minusses:1) There is some strategy to be worked out for doing our current grays - do westick with 16x16 patterns, or allow any size.  If the latter, then there's more logicin the areal repetition.2) If you really mean many 16x16 BLTs to fill an area with gray, this may be alot of overhead for setting up.  Avoiding that overhead is just more logic.3) Also, what about the gray seaming?  The D-S-M spec leaves S as generalpurpose, so that some other mechanism is needed to handle the alignment -either another parameter to specify it, or some special preparation at a higherlevel.4) Finally, the inner loop needs more state and more per-word overhead tostream through the mask.  I can imagine ways around this when the mask isknown to be just a gray pattern but, again, it's more logic.Overall, I think I like what we've got.  I'd say if someone's in an NIH mood, weshould encourage them to try the other way, and see how they like it whenthey're done.*start*01688 00024 US Date: 24 Sept. 1981 2:26 pm PDT (Thursday)From: Pasco.PASubject: Introducing: Ramtek Color Impact PrinterTo: VLSI^, ISL^, CSL^, LilacLovers^, LSIInterest^, RamtekUsers^Reply-to: PascoAn alternative color printer is now in operation in the VLSI System Design Area"Purple Lab", room 2015B.  It's a Ramtek 4100 color impact printer, having fournine-wire ballistic print heads (each with a different colored ink ribbon) on amoving carriage.  It prints 70 dots per inch on 15" by 11" paper.  A public distribution list, RamtekUsers^ has been created.  If you wish toreceive further announcements on the subject, please use Maintain to addyourself to RamtekUsers^.PA.A simple interface program, Aries.run, is now available to drive the printerfrom ".ram" format color-bitmap files.  Work is underway to create a Magicoutput module to generate ".ram" files from LSI layout files (e.g. CIF, Icarus).(The scenario is fully analagous to the Magic Versatec ploting system whereOliver.run drives the Versatec plotter from ".bits" format black-and-whitebitmap files.)  People wishing to write other software to generate ".ram" fileswill find the format documented in [Ivy]<Pasco>Plotting>RamFileFormat.Press.An Alto II, with network name "Color" is interfaced with the 4100.  A disklabelled "Pasco Ramtek" is maintained with a current copy of Aries.Run.  Fornow, the procedure to print a file is to walk to Color, (on the Color keyboard) FTP-retrieve your ".ram" file, then type "Aries <name>.ram".  For demonstration, there exists a sample file on the disk called "foo.ram".Any volunteers wanting to bring up Press would be welcome.	Rich Pasco*start*00844 00024 US Date: 12 Oct. 1981 3:13 pm PDT (Monday)From: Stone.PASubject: AISTo: Knox.wbstcc: Zack.wbst, ISL^.PAReply-To: StoneKeith,I have written a Pilot/Mesa 6 version of the AIS file read/write routines asdescribed in chapter 3 of the AIS manual.

I recommended fixingthis hassle by implementing 'mod' correctly.  In fact, in this particular case,there is an easier way to proceed.  What we are trying to do is to compute	D = ((xvyu))  mod  L.Well, it turns out the you can prove that the inquality	|xvyu| < Lwill always hold.  Thus, in this particular case, you don't need to call any flavorof 'mod';  just do the following:	begin		. . .		z_(xv-yu);		if z<0 then z_z+L;		D_z;		. . .	end.Point 2:Julian commented to me in the hall that Stinger is now running at 384, andhence will be able to handle all the real fonts.  Here is what you should dowhen it comes time for updating Stinger's font dictionary:	(i)  You want to include splines in the dictionary, since Stinger runsPress, and hence can make use of them.	(ii)  You also want to include all the standard rasters, rotated correctly fora printer that scans up the page.	(iii)  But you can't allow this dictionary to include any MultiChars IX'es,since Press can't handle them.This means that we don't really have a good dictionary for the new Stingercurrently on line:	  Lilac's dictionary has the rasters in the wrong rotation.	  Clover's dictionary has MultiChars IX'es, and doesn't have splines.Giving it a few moments thought, I think that the best plan for building a fontdictionary for the new Stinger is:	Start with Clover's dictionary, and run my RotateDict over it with arotation of 0.  This will get rid of the MultiChars IX'es.  Then, merge inSplines.Fonts.Lyle*start*00134 00024 US Date: 21 Oct. 1981 4:09 pm PDT (Wednesday)From: GWilliams.PASubject: Press PasswordTo: GWilliamsBEADGCF*start*00629 00024 US Date: 4 Dec. 1981 3:48 pm PST (Friday)From: GWilliams.PASubject: New "Press" ReleaseTo: ComputerResearch^.pa, Dale.EOS, Bain.Dlos, Fisher.escc: GWilliams, RamshawReply-To: GWilliamsFolks,Press 3.4 is hereby released.

The new features are:	i)  If your file asks to be printed in Transparent mode, an arbitrary		number of color changes are allowed.  For non-Transparent files,		the limit is still 64K color changes.	ii)  There is a new switch, Press/F.  This switch asks Press to be picky		about font matches.  If it is set, Press will call Swat once for each		font request in your Press file that cannot be "perfectly" matched,		telling you the family, size, face, and rotation of the offending		request.By now, there are quite a few switches that Press recognizes, and many of themare probably generally unknown.  Here is a list of this switches whose existenceis suggested by a quick glance at the code;  I am not promising that all of theseswitches actually work as I have described, of course...From the command line:	/C  - do only the "C" pass.	/D  - debug:  if installed for Slot device, ship output raster to the		display, a screenful at a time. 	/F - be picky about font matching:  call Swat with an announcement of		each font request that can't be "perfectly" matched.  Continuing		with ^P will substitute the best match found.	/I  - install.	/L - go for local fidelity rather than global fidelity:  see discussion below.	/M  - do metering.	/O  - don't try and merge rasters on the fly with the Orbit;  that is,		do a software scan conversion ("C" pass) even if it doesn't seem		to be necessary.	/P  - do only the "P" pass.	/R - bit-reverse each scan-line before printing it, hence generating		a mirror-imaged image.	/S  - do only the "S" pass.	/T  - please print in Transparent mode:  each new printing		command simply adds more ink to the page, rather than		later imaging commands overlapping and obscuring		earlier ones.	/U - don't use microcode.	/V - be verbose about error conditions.Four of these switches can also be requested from word 14b=12. of the documentdirectory:  N, R, and T have the same meaning as above, while S is used insteadof O in this context.Discussion of /L semantics, Local Fidelity versus Global Fidelity:	Consider a rectangle that the Press file has specified with micacoordinates, either to be imaged in some color or to be the frame of someShow-Dots.  Press normally defines a pixel to be "inside" this rectangle if andonly if its center is inside the ideal mica-sided rectangle.  This definition has thepleasing property that, if the Press file contains a collection of rectangles thatpartition the plane, then each pixel in the image will be "inside" one and onlyone rectangle.  This property is crucial for the kind of Press file produced byJohn Warnock's code.	Unfortunately, this definition also has the property that rectangles of thesame mica height and width in different locations can end up having differentpixel heights and widths.  At low resolutions, this quantization effect can beannoying, since the lines in your SIL diagrams will be different numbers ofpixels in width.	If you give Press the /L switch, then the width and height of eachrectangle are quantized independently of the rectangle's position.  This techniquestrives for local fidelity, and will make SIL diagrams and the like look better.  Itis not the default condition because the resultant gaps and overlaps of adjoiningrectangles make John Warnock's style of Press file look execrable.------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Maxc]<Alto>PrePress.Run, PrePress.Syms:------------------------------------------------------------------------------Version 2.5 of Prepress is released;  the new version properly rounds points tomicas when accepting sizes from the command line, instead of truncating.Lyle*start*00885 00024 US Date: 15 Jan. 1982 2:11 pm PST (Friday)From: Ramshaw.PASubject: Press version 3.5 is releasedTo: Baskett, Petit, Wilhelm, Dale.EOS, ISL^.pa, cc:  Ramshaw, GWilliamsReply-To: Ramshaw, GWilliamsGlen and I are hereby releasing Press 3.5, which is available on [Maxc]<Press>as usual.

The new version works correctly even		when the merging tree has height greater than 2.Change (ii) was essential for imaging Forest Baskett's data path chip design.  Thedata path chip image generates 83 buffer-loads of bands list (at about 8K wordsper load).  The in-degree of the merging tree is set at 8;  hence, any image withmore than 64 buffer-loads causes a merging tree of height 3.Dan Swinehart ripped the same buggy old merge code out of Spruce long ago,and replaced it;  but his replacement only handles a single four-way merge, nota general merging tree.A hardcopy of Forest's chip is on the wall near Lilac.  There sure are a lot ofrectangles.  Note that a spot on Lilac's drum has wreaked havoc with the circuitnear the lower right-hand corner.  It is sobering thought that the folks in ICLhave to avoid faults that are much smaller than that, even proportionately.Lyle*start*01843 00024 US Date: 2 Feb. 1982 12:15 pm PST (Tuesday)From: Geschke.PASubject: MesaPress file formatTo: GWilliams, Warnockcc: Thacker, Starkweather, GeschkeGlen and John,Would you please respond to Chuck's last question in the attached msg.requesting the file format to be used in driving the reticlemaker?Chuck---------------------------Date: 2 Feb. 1982 11:11 am PST (Tuesday)From: Thacker.PASubject: Reticle GeneratorTo: Starkweather, Geschkecc: ThackerIn pursuit of parallelism, the following thought occurred to me:Let us assume that the mechanical changes Gary is now making to the RG do notwork, i.e., the speed of the scanner still fluctuates more than say .2 bit times inthe course of a scan line.  If this is the case, no amount of correction that ismeasured during one scan and applied during the next will work.For the entire system to work, it will be necessary to go to a grating clock.  Thiswas originally discarded due to electronic complications, and because of thebelief that the scanner's motion would be smooth, even if the speed was notprecise.  Both these assumptions are now questionable.We should begin to reconsider this approach NOW, not later.  If you will tell us:(a) How many bits there are per grating pulse (the fewer the better), and(b)  How many grating clock pulses there are before the plate exposure starts(how long we have to lock the bitclock oscillator - the more the better), we could start the design of a phase-locked bitclock.  I do not believe that if thetwo numbers are reasonable, we should have too much trouble.Also, could you (or your designee) tell us what the format of the files you wantto drive the machine with is, so that we can fix Chipmonk to make them?ThanksChuck------------------------------------------------------------*start*03922 00024 US Date: 2 Feb. 1982 4:37 pm PST (Tuesday)From: GWilliams.PASubject: MesaPress file format (long message)To: Thackercc: Geschke, Warnock, Starkweather, GWilliamsChuck,The bit flinger is currently set up to print one-image files.The format of the file the MesaPress requires is the same as that of Press.bits.Press.bits has leader information that is followed by the scan lines in blockformat.The leader page is 1024 words in length (page 1 of the Trident file).The format of the leader page is described by the FirstPage Mesa record below.	FirstPage: TYPE = MACHINE DEPENDENT RECORD	[	nPages: CARDINAL _ 1,		pageGSize: CARDINAL _ SIZE[PageG],		printerMode: CARDINAL,	--3=portrait, 8=Landscape		password: CARDINAL _ PressPassword,		pageGs: ARRAY[0..92) OF PageG	--enough to fit on a TridentPage	];As shown  in the initialization, nPages should be set to one. "pageGSize" is 11D(nD means the number "n" in deciman).  "printerMode" should be set to 3 or 8,depending on the manner in which the page is scanned: 3 if scanned in portraitmode, 8 if landscape (up the page, lengthwise) mode.It is necessary to follow the password by one PageG record. This describesattributes of the page to be printed.PageG: TYPE=MACHINE DEPENDENT RECORD	--Press's PageG Structure	[FirstBand:	CARDINAL,	--lowest used band	 LastBand:	CARDINAL,	--highest used band	BitMargin:	CARDINAL,	--Margin and	BitWc:	CARDINAL,	--word count of scan lines	BandPos:	LONG CARDINAL, --File position of band stuff	BitPage:	CARDINAL,  --File position of bits (units = 1024 words)	CopyCrucial:	[0..1),		--True if different version needed fordifferrent copies	SimplePage:	[0..1),	ColorPass:	[0..2),	--for color printers: 0=magenta, 1=yellow, 2=cyan,3=black	ColorUsed:	[0..1),	--true if color used (scan conversion used this)	blank:	[0..2048],	PageNumber:	CARDINAL,	--From original Press file.	nRecords:	CARDINAL,	--For spruce-like operation	fontLoad:	CARDINAL]; --ditto	PressPassword: INTEGER = 27183;In order to explain the PageG components, it is necessary to describe the formatof the scan data.  Scan lines appear in the file in uncompressed format. They arearranged in blocks of 16 scan lines for historical reasons. Therefore, a block ofscan lines will take some integral number of Trident pages. That part of the lastpage of the block that is not used for scan data is ignored by the bit flinger (andby Press). The next block appears at the beginning of the next Trident page.For example, if the scan lines are 1600 bits each, one "band", or block, would require 1600 words of space, or CEILING[1600/1024] = 2 Trident pages. Thus, in aPress.bits file, the leader page would be the first data page of the file, followedby two-page band buffers of 16 scan lines each.Now, the PageG:The position of the image on the page is controlled by two quantities: FirstBandand BitMargin. FirstBand is numbered from 1 such that scan line zero appears asthe first scan line of FirstBand. This is used to set the left margin on a landscapemachine, or the top margin on a portrait machine. To start your image at logicalscan address 45 on the page, you would set FirstBand = 3, and zero out the first12 scan lines' worth of space. Thus the first scan line would be output after thescanner waits 44 scans.LastBand is essentially FirstBand+numberOfBandsYou'reOutputting-1.BitMargin is the number of bits into the page to position the beginning of thescan; on a landscape machine, this determines the bottom margin, and on aportrait machine, the left margin. I believe this number is truncated to a multipleof 32 bits on the new SLOT card.BitWc this is the count of 16-bit words in the scan line.Ignore bandPos, CopyCrucial, SimplePage, ColorPass, ColorUsed, blank,PageNumber, nRecords, and fontLoad.Set BitPage to 1.Let me know if you need any other information.Glen*start*00594 00024 US Date: 20 Feb. 1982 12:05 pm EST (Saturday)From: Zack.wbstSubject: VLSI Decompression and DecryptionIn-reply-to: Mitchell.PA's message of 19 Feb. 1982 1:20 pm PST (Friday)To: Mitchell.PAcc: Marshall, Zack, FontStandards^WRC is currently working on a VLSI font decoder for future printers.  DaveDamouth suggests that decryption be built into the chip, but since the design isalready underway (by Sid Marshall), to do so will require fast action.

Do you foresee any difficulties withusing it on fonts?	-- Greg*start*01612 00024 US Date: 22 Feb. 1982 10:47 am PST (Monday)From: Mitchell.PASubject: Re: VLSI Decompression and DecryptionIn-reply-to: Zack.wbst's message of 20 Feb. 1982 12:05 pm EST (Saturday)To: Zack.wbstcc: Mitchell, Marshall.wbst, FontStandards^.wbstI'm not sure what a "VLSI font decoder" is supposed to do, but I assume it is arelatively high bandwidth device (otherwise why not use software?) withreal-time speed requirements.  Now a page/second printer with 400 pixel/inchresolution consumes more than 15Mbits/second (400*400*8.5*11).  The fastest DESchip I know of goes at 10Mbits/second and is a VERY complicated IC.  So if myassumption about the VLSI font decoder is correct, it is not reasonable to put DESdecryption into it as well.Besides, I see no good reason to keep fonts encrypted up to the point they areactually used to spew out bits.  When a print server acquires a font, it shoulddecrypt it immediately.  After all, the customer is trusting the printer's softwareto be correct in a number of ways that are as critical as this (e.g., it doesn't dropparagraphs or lines of text).  Furthermore, if encryption is good for fonts, it ismuch better for documents that a company doesn't want to go over the Ethernetin the clear.  Encryption is a function that is useful in a number of ways andplaces and therefore ought to be generally available (this argument would be lessstrong if the cost and complexity of encryption were comparable to an ALU,which we do now sprinkle all over rather than attempting to share amongseparate pieces of hardware).		Jim Mitchell*start*00586 00024 US Date: 22 Feb. 1982 2:48 pm EST (Monday)From: Marshall.WBSTSubject: Re: VLSI Decompression and DecryptionIn-reply-to: Zack's message of 20 Feb. 1982 12:05 pm EST (Saturday)To: Zackcc: Mitchell.PA, Marshall, FontStandards^Reply-To: MarshallThe NBS encryption standard is too slow for real-time bit generation ofcharacters.

Can you tell us which it is? How suitable is it to handle Kanji characters?On the subject of font encryption, either the leak is within Xerox or it is without Xerox.If within, no encryption method can help -- I think.If without, the question is whether the important information is in the bitmaps themselves or in the whole; I think the time consuming task is to tune the font bitmaps; but, in that case, security is virtually non-existent, as getting to the bitmaps is as easy as intercepting, in the case of the 804x Print Server (Star Print Server) for instance, the video stream running from the Dandelion to the Raven (i.e., as easy as monitoring an easily tapped line). Perhaps we should encrypt the video stream as well! But then, all that has to be done is intercept (optically) the modulated laser beam....So the idea is interesting, but I am skeptical.Claude.*start*00750 00024 US Date: 26 Feb. 1982 3:17 pm PST (Friday)From: Stone.PASubject: ShowAisTo: ISL^cc: StoneReply-To: StoneFolks,I have been doing some new packaging on ShowAis, which is the program thatdisplays the color AIS files on the color monitor on Lexington.

It has bugs.However, after considering that there may be millions of rectangles in a reticleband file, I think encoding as tightly as possible is very worthwhile, and I amwilling to write and support the code in order to save millions of words andmicroseconds.Proposal: Reticle band files contain a herald record (as before) with ID,bandCount, bandWidth, bandHeight, etc.  Then, following are all the rectanglesfor band 0, then an end object, then all rectangles for band 1, an end object ...up thru band 639.  A rectangle object is encoded in either of two forms:	SHORT: three words, 0: xmin, 1: ymin, 2: byte: deltaX, byte: deltaY.	LONG: four words, 0: xmin, 1: ymin, 2: xmax, 3: ymax.xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax are 15 bit quantities in [0..25,000)Bit 0 of a rectangle object is 0 IF SHORT ELSE 1.A LONG object with xmin=ymin=xmax=ymax=77777B is an END object.My intent is that these files can be created using byte/word streams withouthaving to back up in a stream.Please read this over and respond to the proposal.Answering some questions Alan Bell has already posed:1.) What is the device number for reticle maker: 3.2.) The field size for the band field is 8 bits.  The     maximum band is 630.    Where do the 2 extra bits go:        That's a bug. Band numbers are 12 bits in new herald.3.) How should I handle trapeziods? 	I was told (assumed??) that only black rectangles were required.  If you	really need trapezoids, we have to add them to the encoding.4.) Can I use values of bandHeight less than that in the document?     A number that is a power of 2 would be a little easier.	The herald values are derived:  given ~62 KWords of band buffer 	available in an Alto IIXM and	a scan length of 1536 words(25000/16), the maximum number of	scanlines that will fit in the buffer is around 40.  You are free to use	smaller numbers, say 32.5.) Should the bands be sorted in the band file?	Absolutely. But, only in Y, traversing the bands.

That stillfits in <= 40 scanlines per band. Also, some bugs in the record formats are corrected below, so delete yesterday's message:---------------------------Date: 15 March 1982 11:28 am PST (Monday)From: Pier.PASubject: Band FilesTo: ABell, Thacker, Petit, Starkweathercc: Warnock, GWilliams, PierReply-To: PierPlease IGNORE my previous definition and picture for band files.  It has bugs.However, after considering that there may be millions of rectangles in a reticleband file, I think encoding as tightly as possible is very worthwhile, and I amwilling to write and support the code in order to save millions of words andmicroseconds.Proposal: Reticle band files contain a herald record (as before) with ID,bandCount, bandWidth, bandHeight, etc.  Then, following are all the rectanglesfor band 0, then an end object, then all rectangles for band 1, an end object ...up thru band 639.  A rectangle object is encoded in either of two forms:	SHORT: three words, 0: xmin, 1: ymin, 2: byte: deltaX, byte: deltaY.	LONG: four words, 0: xmin, 1: ymin, 2: xmax, 3: ymax.xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax are 15 bit quantities in [0..25,400)Bit 0 of a rectangle object is 0 IF SHORT ELSE 1.A LONG object with xmin=ymin=xmax=ymax=77777B is an END object.My intent is that these files can be created using byte/word streams withouthaving to back up in a stream.Please read this over and respond to the proposal.Answering some questions Alan Bell has already posed:1.) What is the device number for reticle maker: 3.2.) The field size for the band field is 8 bits.  The     maximum band is 630.    Where do the 2 extra bits go:        That's a bug. Band numbers are 12 bits in new herald.3.) How should I handle trapeziods? 	I was told (assumed??) that only black rectangles were required.  If you	really need trapezoids, we have to add them to the encoding.4.) Can I use values of bandHeight less than that in the document?     A number that is a power of 2 would be a little easier.	The herald values are derived:  given ~63 KWords of band buffer 	available in an Alto IIXM and	a scan length of 1588 words(25400/16), the maximum number of	scanlines that will fit in the buffer is around 40.  You are free to use	smaller numbers, say 32.5.) Should the bands be sorted in the band file?	Absolutely. But, only in Y, traversing the bands. Not needed in X.	This is a coarse bucket sort, with the bands being buckets.	I did not specify sorting in the previous message, but	that is fundamental to the band file architecture.6.) What coordinate system is used.  (Where is 0,0 and +X,+y).	0,0 in upper left corner. Top to bottom, left to right,	just like an Alto screen.7.) How can software be tested?

Such equipment is primarily intended fordevelopment of Unicorn software and/or hardware modules and would be onpermanent loan to the individual doing the work.Let me once again iterate my statement on "strings":  Given good faith and thecompletion of a project before any departure from the employ of Xerox Corp., andin the absence of distinct threats to security (e.g. personal bankruptcy and yourcreditor is IBM..) prior to IMO of Unicorn, there ARE NO STRINGS.  We simplynever expect to see the equipment again.Equipment needs to relate to the project - Unicorn as we know it and perhaps tofuture advanced models;  and the amount will be based on the same fundamentalbasis that we have worked on before -- commensurate with the work magnitudeand the success of the product.  So you would get a Unicorn with peripherals upfront, and if what you do sells or helps us be a real winner in the marketplace,we agree on the equipment needed and what you need, and we will take care ofgetting it shipped to you.We feel strongly that this is in the interests of everyone concerned -- it avoidsputting you in conflict of interest.  A conflict could arise if your managementfelt that you were getting paid from two sources -- them for your regular job,and Unicorn for an extracurricular activity that would possibly divert energyfrom your assigned tasks.  We want you and your management to be comfortablewith this.

That is,x coordinates don't change from the global reticle coordinate system, but ycoordinates have the y value of the start of their band subtracted out.  This willsave the printer from doing that conversion on every y coordinate for BITBLTinto the reticle band bitmap buffer.Ken*start*01025 00024 US Date: 18 March 1982 4:37 pm PST (Thursday)From: Starkweather.PASubject: Re: Revised Band File FormatIn-reply-to: Your message of 18 March 1982 12:02 pm PST (Thursday)To: Piercc: Starkweather, ABell, Thacker, Petit, Starkweather, McCreight, Warnock, GwilliamsKen, after reviewing the new band format for Reticles, it seems that since the Ycoordinates of objects are band relative, Ymin and deltaY can never exceed 40and hence will fit within a byte. DeltaX on the other hand could be 15 bits.Why not change the short object format to xmin(15 bits), deltaX(15 bits), andymin(8 bits) where deltaX was previously specified and then deltaY (8bits) canbe left at its current specification. This would permit all rectangles to be shortobjects and eliminate the need for long objects. Things could be left the waythey are except that rectangles having deltaX in excess of 256 bits must becomelong objects and the value of relative band count is diminished. Please advise ifyou agree.Gary *start*01135 00024 US Date: 18 March 1982 4:53 pm PST (Thursday)From: Steffensen.PASubject: Liberty Ship ScheduleTo: Junk^cc:  SteffensenReply-To: SteffensenThe SS Jeremiah O'Brien, America's last unaltered Liberty Ship will be open tothe public with the triple expansion steam engine running and the original coalstove galley in operation on the third weekend of each month in 1982 (with theexception of May, July, and December) as per this schedule:March	20-21	Chocolate chip cookies free on board, Sat., 20thApril		17-18 May		15	Annual Seamen's Memorial Bay Cruise, Sat., 15th			(advance reservations required, $50) ship closed SundayJune		19-20	Live Big Band Music on board, Sat., 19thJuly		3-4    August	21-22   September	18-19October	16-17	Steam Winch demonstration, Sat., 16thNovember	20-21December		Not open Hours:	10:00 AM to 3:00 PMLocation:	Pier 3 East, Fort Mason, San FranciscoDonation:  	$2/adults; $1/seniors & children; $5/families Info per:  	SS Jeremiah O'Brien, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, 		National Park Service, Fort Mason, San Francisco  94123		Telephone 415/441-3101	*start*01008 00024 US Date: 19 March 1982 9:40 am PST (Friday)From: Pier.PASubject: Re: Revised Band File FormatIn-reply-to: Starkweather's message of 18 March 1982 4:37 pm PST (Thursday)To: Starkweathercc: Pier, ABell, Thacker, Petit, McCreight, Warnock, GwilliamsYep.

Since the dl has been quietfor a while, it seems appropriate to point out recent changes.Fonts	Wabash maintains a 3-level font cache (memory, local disk, remote disk)	and automatically retrieves needed system fonts from a standard IFS	file server.  This relieves the need for a large font data base at the	printer.  On our experimental Penguin, we keep 40 fonts locally and	300-400 "fonts of record" are on the [Cask] IFS.  (ClearingHouse later!)	Private fonts continue to be accepted via the FTP connection and applied	to Press files sent at the same time.  This is a great tool for font developers	as they can easily see the recent changes to their artwork.  The Quartz	font families were developed this way.Pictorials	Wabash now accepts a generalized tile size MxN (M must be a power of	2).  The microcode is faster and I've seen pictures as large as 8" x 6" on	the Penguin.	We're making changes to make Wabash and Gemini compatible.  Shortly,	it will be easy to merge AIS pictures into pre-formatted Bravo text.	Early output looks great.Color (non-black objects)	The 2-14 release prints color objects (non-black).  That is, it substitutes	a gray inkwell for the color and then images the text, rules, splines, etc.	The inkwell bitmaps reside in an Inks3.oc font; our standard set has 16	inkwells, thanks to Chuck Dvorak.  Since inks are a font, you can send	your inks via the private font mechanism (indicated above). 	This is a first attempt at inkwell colors and some problems remain in the	mapping of HSB to ink ID and priority.  For a first try, print the file	<Sil>ColorChart.press; then use Sil to make some shaded boxes, etc.  I'd	avoid Griffin and overlays until we implement macros.Miscellaneous	Job spooling and processing is much improved; much better printer status	reporting.		Increased decomposition speed for standard text proceesing; all disk IO is	now faster (goes directly from disk to XM, skipping bank 0).	VideoFiles are accepted from the net (BandLists and RasterLoads).  Those	using the VFU pattern generator package can run off-line or save your	favorite file and print it later.  VFU has been extended and improved.	The command line interface was dropped; no invocations via com.cm.That's about it for now.  To get started with disks, code, inks, fonts, etc. you cancontact John <Blanchard> (8-222-2166) or me.  For the near future, we will complete the work on inks, link up with the AISGemini subsystem, produce a real breakpage, and establish communications withthe NPA front-end which will off-load spooling, make-ready operations, andclient communications).  Also we have been experimenting with compressedformats for large characters (96+ points) and/or high resolution.  These should beincorporated as well.  Those of you interested in using inkwells for true colorshould contact me separately.Dan*start*00634 00024 US Date:  2-Apr-82 17:11:46 PST (Friday)From: Israel.paSubject: Experimental File ServiceTo: StarUsers^.esReply-To: Israel.pacc: SDD-AD^Friends,A new file service will soon appear in OSBU North.

I have not studied the document in great detail, so mycomments are not "nits," but rather somehwat more general:1. (Important) It seems to me that an important interaction between aprinter and programs that create files for it has been omitted fromTelepress, namely the ability for the creator to obtain a "metricmaster" as described in the Interpress spec that contains informationabout the printer's environment: font widths, etc. While obtainingthis file will be an infrequent occurrence, it seems to me it oughtto be one of the standardized interactions with the printer. (Bycontrast, functions to install various printer-dependent files suchas forms and fonts don't, it seems to me, need to be handled in astandardized way.) The point is that a program (or workstationcontaining the program) ought to be able to become connected to theEthernet and to obtain in a standard way enough information to printa file. Presumably the clearinghouse will point to a printer, butwhat about the font metrics?2. (Less important) What is the general mechanism by which particularprinters will extend Telepress if need be? Should the Telepressdesign spell out extension strategies that are deemed acceptable?Bob*start*00506 00024 US Date: 16 April 1982 1:58 pm PST (Friday)From: GWilliams.PASubject: Reticle printingTo: Starkweather, Petit, ABell, McCreightcc: Pier, Warnock, Thacker, GWilliamsI recently changed ReticlePress to change its Slot buffer allocation scheme toaccomodate 25K+ scan lines.

The balance of thismessage illustrates a  fundamental difference we have on this matter, and aproposed solution.When last we talked, you told me you were going to put a file on the user's diskthat would tell you whether to process a reticle or an "Interpress" bands file. What I don't understand is why you don't use that information in decidingwhich file to look up in, say, PressBandsOps.Instead of opening one file or the other based on the information at hand, youreplicated the module with only the filename lookup changed.  Lately I haveadded functionality to another file I gave you access to, PressNetListener.  Ifound that, again, there are two versions with only one line of code different. The task of updating parallel sets of code is not easily orchestrated, and in thesecases, easily avoidable.For instance, the two modules PressNetListener and ReticlePressNetListener  eachcall the same procs from my GetBitsFromBands: ShowBandsInit and ShowBands.In PressNetListener you import the procs from one defs module and fromReticlePressNetListener you import the same proc names from a different one.This is unnecessary.  You need only one defs file (the two are identicle anyway)and then just bind the appropriate module in the Configuration.  This wouldmake the whole issue of "nearly duplicate" files vanish, and indeed is theprimary reason the configuration language exists.I know that we both would like to move on in our respective projects, but if weare to maintain these projects it seems to me that we should not add unnecessarycomplexity.Cheers,Glen*start*00570 00024 US Date: 16 April 1982 2:04 pm PST (Friday)From: GWilliams.PASubject: Press version 4.2 is releasedTo: DNelson, Scharfetter, Jung, PMartin, Dale.EOS, Hunt, ISL^.pa, Orr, DBrowncc: Ramshaw, GWilliamsReply-To: GWilliamsPress 4.2 is available on [Maxc]<Press>:	Press.Run, and Press.Syms.This is a minor change that shouldn't affect anyone not making reticles.

Beginning this May, Tioga will again be available as aprint server.  This latest revision improves the response seen when transmitting a job. This wasdone by continuing to listen for jobs except when actually printing.The revision supports the NPAprint protocol used by the NPA DocumentCoordinator.The revision also interfaces with the soon to be released Gemini system forediting and formatting documents containing both text and pictorials.Documents printed by the new system are accompanied by a personalized breakpage, complete with information about who printed it, when it was done, whatwas printed, and any errors or abnormalities which may have occured.The system preserves the integrity of graphic objects.  This was not the case forour previous release and was visible where two differently colored objectsoverlapped.  Unfortunately, prioity of overlapping objects is still not handledvery well, and sometimes what you think of as one object (such as a bordergenerated by Griffin) is in fact several objects in the Press file.  The moral is ifyou don't like surprises, then don't overlap differently colored objects.Our new release has a provision for a compressed font format (rulette-encoded). Large sized fonts can be encoded into this format to save space.  We can nowsupport more and larger fonts than was previously possible.*start*00932 00024 US Date: 3 May 1982 10:05 am PDT (Monday)From: Ramshaw.PASubject: Press 4.103To: Warnock, Wyattcc: GWilliams, RamshawJohn and Doug,Stinger is now running with a bootleg special version of Press, called 4.103;  theonly difference from 4.3 is Metering of font data.

Then, for each page, the number of distinct character codes thatappear on that page and the total space that the rasters for those charactersoccupy (in Orbitized format, at 384 bpi, counting the two-word header for eachcharacter) is dribbled in binary.  In addition, the same two statistics are outputfor each font load as a whole.  (It would be much harder to get data that wouldspan more than one font load.)

While doing this, there are several enhancements I would like to make to the specification to make it more intuitive.  John Beeley suggested that I solicit reactions to the changes from group members.The first set of changes I would like to make are purely cosmetic.  The names of some of the procedures and types, I believe, could be improved upon, namely:a) Except for Print, the procedure names do not indicate that they are in fact operations, as opposed to data items.  To make it more obvious, I would like to change	PrinterProperties	to GetPrinterProperties	PrinterStatus		to GetPrinterStatus	PrintRequestStatus	to GetRequestStatusb) If the above changes are made, less stilted names can be used for the various types.  I would like to change	PrintOptionsSequence	to PrintOptions	PrinterPropertiesSequence to PrinterProperties	PrintRequestStatusReply	to RequestStatus	StatusOfPrinter		to PrinterStatus	MediaSequence		to Mediac) To maintain consistency of field naming, since there is a field called "recipientName", the field "sender" should be changed to "senderName".d) To bring the specification into line with common usage, I would like to change	beginningPageNumber	to beginningPlateNumber	endingPageNumber	to endingPlateNumber	pagesToPrint		to platesToPrint(these all occur in the "PrintOptionsSequence" type)e) To be most explict, I would like to change the name of the error SpoolFull to SpoolingQueueFull.I would like to make a set of changes that are of a slightly substantive nature.  By and large these changes make for a neater Courier specification.  The changes do modify the specification slightly, but are almost invisible.f) Instead of having one error with an enumerated argument for the different errors that may arise, it has been suggested to define an explicit error for each.g) Regardless of the outcome of f), it has been suggested to add the errors PrintObjectTooLarge and InsufficientSpoolSpace to further refine the error SpoolFull.h) Regardless of the outcomes of f) and g), it has been suggested to change the numbers of the errors so that they are consecutive.i) I would like to eliminate the type StatusOfRequest and define the enumeration directly in the type PrintRequestStatusReply (as far as I can tell, the only place it is used) as is done with all of the other enumerations.j) It has been suggested that to conform with common usage, the order of the fields "length" and "width" in the record "variable" in the type "Papers" be reversed.In order to get the Telepress document edited in a timely fashion, I need an indication of your reactions to these changes at an early date.  I suggest responses be in my hands by May 18.  Unless I receive strong objections, I'm going to proceed with these changes.*start*00801 00024 US Date: 15 MAY 1982 0640-PDTFrom: SPROULL.PASubject: Your cosmetic changes proposedTo:   ladnercc:   telepressdesign^.esOn the whole, I'm for it. There is one small issue, however.It may be that the term "plate" is in common usage in somequarters, but the term "pgae" is used throughout the Interpressdefinition. Since the fields that refer to "plates"(or "pages") are really used to edit the Interpress master in atrivial way before it is printed (the editing operation is to selectcertain "page bodies" from the master), I would suggest you preservethe Interpress terminology. Otherwise there will be confusion tosomeone who reads the Interpress and Telepressdocuments and finds "plates" used in Telepress with no ereferenceto such an object in Interpress.Bob*start*00565 00024 US Date: 22 March 1982 6:42 pm PST (Monday)From: Pier.PASubject: Revised Band File FormatTo: ABell, Thacker, Petit, Starkweather, McCreightcc: Warnock, GWilliams, PierReply-To: PierPrint [ivy]<Pier>Reticle>ReticleBandFormat.press for a new and hopefully finalband file format.New features include a herald object defaulted to the canonical parameters forReticleMaker, and a new object called HornetHerald you can use for putting testoutput on Stinger.

We currently have one ErrorType for these 3 cases: spoolFull.I propose that we add two ErrorTypes:	printObjectTooLarge -- case (a)	insufficientSpoolSpace -- case (b)which, together with spoolFull, should cover the three cases.A server may only raise 'spoolFull' or 'insufficientSpoolSpace' but at least the 'printObjectTooLarge' ErrorType will be available for the discriminating server.  [For the 8044, case (a) can be handled by either breaking the doc up into smaller pieces or, possibly, judiciously deleting fonts at the server.]Note that adding these (or others) at this late date should have no affect on the standardization process.  Not adding them may cause problems if they get added in some later implementation.	//John*start*01368 00024 US Date: 14 June 1982 11:48 am PDT (Monday)From: Ramshaw.PASubject: Versatec landscape/portrait switch in PressTo: Knox.wbstcc: GWilliams.pa, Swinehart.pa, Venable.wbst, RamshawKeith,Dan caught me talking about Versatec plotting in the hall today, and told meabout your recent inquiry.

Shouldn't the EtherPrint protocols require authentication of the client'scredentials?  Otherwise anyone anywhere on the network can cause the printingresource to be used, even though they may not be authorized to do so.  In theenvironments where printing is charged to individuals or to accounts**, thecapability for authenticating and authorizing use would seem to be important. This comes up first on page 301, where dependencies are identified."*****  The 9700 has extensive accounting features and will probably drive its definition.  See response to 5, below.*** Authentication is a valid concern and an area we covered in our earlier design discussions where we decided that it should be included in the extensions to the protocol.  At the time of our discussions the Authentication proposal was not well defined and the correct solution to this problem was not fully understood."4.  Medium:   Is it sufficient to have paper as the only medium?  Doesn't the9700 have a microfiche option**, and aren't there requirements for adding otherkinds of media as well, such as transparencies and cover stock?***  A small nit:  in Interpress I believe we have used meters as the unit of measure; shouldn't we dothe same here?****  Also, for the sake of clarity and education of programmers, itwould be a good idea to define, at least in Appendix B, the dimensions of all thepaper sizes that we reference.*****"** This is why we defined the "Medium" as a CHOICE.  There are other possiblities and the CHOICE can eventually expand from paper to microfilm or whatever in subsequent updates.  Again, since the 9700 offers the microfiche option, those folks will probably drive its definition.*** As for "transparencies and cover stock" (or paper weight, color, letterhead or other preprinted, etc), this is beyond EtherPrint and has to left for Interpress Instructions for at least two reasons: (a) it deals with the page-by-page printing instructions and (b) the instructions, once defined, should remain with the master.  This leaves the question of determining what a particular printer can handle unanswered.  Maybe, as has been suggested, we'll have to return an Instructions-like construct which gives the spectrum of capabilities and inventory at a particular printer.**** Interpress uses meters because it handles fractions and can perform transformations and scaling on the measurements to reduce it to usable values.  Milimeters (and inches) is the typical measurement for defining paper sizes.***** I agree, the dimensions should be defined in the spec.  (They were all there at one time.)"5.  Print Attributes and Print Options:  Accounting typically requires more thanjust the sender name, and there should be provision for an account identifier towhich charges can be accumulated.**  Also, I would think it important to have asone of the print options a security classification identifier***.  There are also other finishing options, such as a stacker, the ability to offset sets, the use ofmailboxes, microfiche output, etc.****"** I believe that the 9700 folks wanted the accounting info in the Interpress Instructions since a lot of their clients that would be using Interpress would not (at least intially) be using EtherPrint.*** I don't know what a "security classification identifier" would mean.  Is this something that gets printed or some hint about where it is to be printed or how to handle it once its been printed?**** Some of these were covered in our discussions but we concluded that the current options represented a common, generic capability for our range of printers.  There is provision for extensions to EtherPrint by adding to the PrintOptions choices."6.  Printer Properties:  Shouldn't it be possible to determine the fonts available on a printer**, the type of printer***, whether or not it has a microfiche output, etc.?****"** Yes, it is both desirable and possible (in an EtherPrint extension) to determine fonts.  But what further properties does one want to know about the fonts:  sizes, orientations, character subsets, resident at the printer or ...?*** Please define "type of printer".**** Possible in an EtherPrint extension.*start*01088 00024 US Date: 24 June 1982 12:44 am PDT (Thursday)From: Morris.PASubject: Bravo to Tioga ConversionTo: CedarUsers^Reply-To: MorrisI have written a program to do simple-minded conversion of Bravo files to Tiogafiles.

Xerox 8044/8045 (about $30,000 to 35,000--12 pages per minute, 300    dots per inch).  But it seems to be hard to convince Xerox to    release the Interpress specifications so this may be limited to    being driven from Stars.  Unilogic Scribe will probably support    it in time.  Interpress has been said to be Xerox's new    standard language.  10 mB Ethernet interface.2.  Imagen and its interface to LBP-10.  Uses the Canon LBP-10 which    is 240 dots to the inch.  Around $30K.  10 pages/minute.    Supported by Unilogic Scribe, TeX, and the new TROFF.  RS-232    interface.  Some talk of ethernet interface.3.  Symbolics and its interface to LBP-10.  Still awaiting information    on this one.  Possibly $25K.  Talk of all sorts of interfaces    (unibus, RS-232, ethernet, etc.).  People seem quite excited by    this one.4.  Dec LN01.  Based on the same print engine as Xerox 8044/45.  Still    awaiting information on this one.  This one is also attracting    attention.5.  Xerox 2900 (I think that's the number).  A Laser Printer Diablo.    About $19K.6.  Miscellaneous others on which we don't have much information--Perq    interface to Canon LBP-10, Lilith interface to Canon LPB-10 ($15K    for the printer; the Lilith interface to the Canon--a Lilith costs    $15K and an ethernet board goes for about $3K); General Optronics'    laser printer (I don't know anything else about it).I hope this is what you wanted to hear.

Most of the time this means that the printer is out ofpaper.  If so, or if there's a paper jam, the LED next to the Start Test button willbe lit.  Read the directions on the printer for loading the paper cassette, do so,lift the top of the printer and close it again, swat out of the K0 state, do pressreprint, and then type @Server.cm to put the machine back on the air.  K0 mayalso indicate a paper jam, in which case you open the top of the machine,remove the paper gone astray {should be self-evident:  everything not in thepaper cassette or output tray is considered to be astray}, close the machine andproceed as above.  K0 may also indicate incompatibility with your file; if theLED is not lit, swat and do a press reprint.  This may help; if not, it doesn't likeyour file and you should change it.Quoth [formerly Lenore], has three error messages.  K0 indicates an undefinedprinting error which is not recoverable.  Check the LED display on the printerand follow any codes displayed there to track down paper jams.  It may alsoindicate dissatisfaction with your file, and a swat and press reprint may helphere, too.K1 on the Alto display indicates that the printer is out of paper.   The LEDdisplay atop the printer will say C4.  Follow the directions on the printer toreplenish the paper supply, being sure to replace each paper cassette in the slotfrom which it came; if it's still not happy, wiggle the paper cassettes and thelocking handle until it is.K2 indicates that the printer has shut itself down from lack of use [a feature ofRaven printers].  The print request will start up the Raven again; until it isready it will display L1 on the LED display.  When it is ready, the display willgo blank again; at that time, hitting CR will cause the file to print.I trust this clarifies some of the confusion which Quoth, in particular, hasoccasioned.  If not, come talk to me or send me questions.Julian*start*00419 00024 US Date: 5 Aug. 1982 2:42 pm PDT (Thursday)From: Pier.PASubject: ReticlePress revisionTo: McCreight, GWilliamscc:  PierI made the change to expand each rectangle, per Ed's request.

The most common aliens in the galaxy, the SpaceCadets, are once more present on this planet, weaving their plots against reality,coherence, the ability to stand upright, and a straight face.  No more the obviousaliens, no tentacles, green slime, extra eyes or mandibles, no, now the foulfiends have adopted human bodies [well, almost human] in their search fordominance.  Their vile stratagem is simple:  They offer you a pipe, this clearsthe space between your ears, favorite dwelling site of space cadets, then theyhaul in a mobile home, use your sewer hookup, and presto!!!  No, sorry, that'sanother scenario . . . then they drop a cute little scorpion in your ear, it turnsaround three times and presto!  right between your very eyes, you're now analien Eichler, open beam ceiling and all.And what stands between these dastards and the desecration of all we hold dear,Mommie Dearest, imitation apple pie, and Japanese-made polyester flags with thestars crooked?  Why, nothing but a handful of ducks!  For reasons best known tothemselves, these fowl fiends like to play Sophtspheroid.  With "normal" humanopponents, everyone whom they can suck up to their pipe succumbsimmediately, they get distracted in subdividing these new housing tracts, andthat's too much like work.  Others refuse the pipe and beat them senseless; cadetsderive little pleasure from this [except for a few slightly twisted ones, ofcourse].  Ducks, on the other hand, their lot in life does not immediately becomevacant, no, between their ears is such a dense, matted, tightly-curled,impenetrable mass of pickerel weed that there's not room for a neuron to turnaround, let alone a fully-fledged scorpion, and I've seen some with heavyfeathers, pard.  Ducks, if possible, get even denser between the ears whenexposed to pipes, and the remaining open spaces are always awash with duckjuice; some eminent alienists have gone completely gaga and had to be carried,screaming, back to their cupboards after attempting to make sense out of afully-loaded duck.And so the contest goes, pipes full of pickerel weed, aliens full of duck juice; bythe end of reeling around the bases, the ball is fowl and the cadets are so fargone in space that the earth is saved, at least until the next game.  At least sofar.

I think I have found the problem:  the code in Press for rotating bitmapscurrently only handles 1 bit/sample and 8 bits/sample (each with differentspecial microcode for speed).  Thus, if the Dots data in the Press file has its scanlines going in the same direction as the scan lines of the printing engine(vertical for Jedi, horizontal for Lilac), then any sample size will work.  But, ifthe Dots data scan lines run perpendicular to the output device scan lines, thenonly 1 bit/sample and 8 bits/sample are supported at the moment.  This doesn'tlook too easy to fix, unfortunately:  fixing it would demand writing some newcode, and probably even new microcode.Lyle*start*00499 00024 US From: Putz.PADate:  7-Oct-82 19:16:03 PDTSubject: Re: Limitation of press printer programIn-reply-to: Ramshaw's message of 7 Oct. 1982 10:52 am PDT (Thursday)To: Ramshawcc: Putz, GWilliamsLyle,Thanks for solving the mystery!

Suppose, however, that oneis using a floating point number system to approximate the real numbers.  Canthe errors in the floating point arithmetic make it appear as if two lines intersectmore than once?  In particular, think of each line as a function that returns afloating point value of the ordinate  y  for each floating point value of theabscissa   x.  We will say that two lines braid if there exists a sequence of threevalues for the abscissa  a < b < c  such that, at  a  and  c, the first line isstrictly higher than the second, while at  b, the second is strictly higher thanthe first.  This note presents enough bad examples to suggest that anystraightforward implementation of lines over the floating point numbers willinclude pairs of lines that braid.  It is possible to avoid braiding, but it isn'teasy;  we will close by sketching one braid-free implementation, using doubleprecision arithmetic. *start*00344 00024 US Date: 26 Oct. 1982 5:14 pm PDT (Tuesday)From: Plass.PASubject: Unified fonts for Cedar, revisited.To: ISL^, Ramshawcc: PlassReply-To: PlassUFonts.mesa is now called UnifiedFonts.mesa.

It has a custom 68000board stuck inside the Canon.  Brian says the Symbolics system has "extremelygood software support for various printing formats, including those usedby TRoff, TeX and Scribe." (this is in contrast to the IMAGEN printer, heclaims, which supports TRoff output "at substantially degraded quality.")Sorry, Brian, both Symbolics and IMAGEN support TRoff in exactly the sameway, with exactly the same quality of output: TRoff's CAT output is convertedto the native language of the printer in question.  Further, Scribe DOES NOTsupport the Symbolics printer.  It may in a few months, but check withUnilogic for details.  Scribe DOES support the IMAGEN printer, and sinceUnilogic has an IMAGEN printer, it will probably always have rather goodsupport for it.Brian claims the Symbolics printer can "use Chaosnet or Ethernet linksat additional cost."  Ignoring the confusion of hardware vs softwareprotocols, that is false at the current time.  Symbolics is planning (I'veheard) to offer 10mb Ethernet hardware with Chaosnet protocols (just fineif you have Lisp machines) sometime in first quarter '83.  Let me point outthat IMAGEN will offer 10mb Ethernet hardware, with both Chaosnet andTCP/IP software, within 3 months (1 March 82).Back to the "substantially degraded quality" of output from the IMAGENprinter.  Besides being false, it will get more false, as IMAGEN will beoffering, as part of the first commercial release of the software in itsprinter, a native CAT emulation mode to avoid the host overhead ofthe conversion from CAT to native language.Brian's claim that the firmware is extremely flakey, requiring a resetevery 4 jobs he prints, can only come from some extreme confusion aboutsomething.  IMAGEN has 70+ systems in the field, and none of them havecomplained about such a situation (neither has Brian complained to usdirectly, so that we might clear up any problems which he might have).Also note that Stanford has 17 systems, all of them bought at 10% listprice, and that part of IMAGEN's agreement with Stanford is that theywould maintain them themselves; thus, Brian's claim that he can't getany support out of IMAGEN is puzzling.If you are still convinced by Brian's misleading statements, try contactingsome of IMAGEN's customers.

Goodfellow  <Geoff5 at SRI-CSL>Remailed-to: Info-VAX@SRI-CSL: ;Brian Reid's recent missive concerning laser printers was mostly quiteinformative, but on the issue of the IMAGEN vs. Symbolics printing systems,he is rather misinformed and, I think it is fair to say, blatantly vitriolic.NB:  I work for IMAGEN, but I'll try to keep my remarks objective.The Symbolics Canon-based printer is NOT based on the LM-1 or LM-2 or anysuch beast; if it were, it would cost about $125K!  It has a custom 68000board stuck inside the Canon.  Brian says the Symbolics system has "extremelygood software support for various printing formats, including those usedby TRoff, TeX and Scribe." (this is in contrast to the IMAGEN printer, heclaims, which supports TRoff output "at substantially degraded quality.")Sorry, Brian, both Symbolics and IMAGEN support TRoff in exactly the sameway, with exactly the same quality of output: TRoff's CAT output is convertedto the native language of the printer in question.  Further, Scribe DOES NOTsupport the Symbolics printer.  It may in a few months, but check withUnilogic for details.  Scribe DOES support the IMAGEN printer, and sinceUnilogic has an IMAGEN printer, it will probably always have rather goodsupport for it.Brian claims the Symbolics printer can "use Chaosnet or Ethernet linksat additional cost."  Ignoring the confusion of hardware vs softwareprotocols, that is false at the current time.  Symbolics is planning (I'veheard) to offer 10mb Ethernet hardware with Chaosnet protocols (just fineif you have Lisp machines) sometime in first quarter '83.  Let me point outthat IMAGEN will offer 10mb Ethernet hardware, with both Chaosnet andTCP/IP software, within 3 months (1 March 82).Back to the "substantially degraded quality" of output from the IMAGENprinter.  Besides being false, it will get more false, as IMAGEN will beoffering, as part of the first commercial release of the software in itsprinter, a native CAT emulation mode to avoid the host overhead ofthe conversion from CAT to native language.Brian's claim that the firmware is extremely flakey, requiring a resetevery 4 jobs he prints, can only come from some extreme confusion aboutsomething.  IMAGEN has 70+ systems in the field, and none of them havecomplained about such a situation (neither has Brian complained to usdirectly, so that we might clear up any problems which he might have).Also note that Stanford has 17 systems, all of them bought at 10% listprice, and that part of IMAGEN's agreement with Stanford is that theywould maintain them themselves; thus, Brian's claim that he can't getany support out of IMAGEN is puzzling.If you are still convinced by Brian's misleading statements, try contactingsome of IMAGEN's customers.  Most of them are extremely happy (modulo theinherent problems with the LBP-10, which, as a wet process printer, hasdrawbacks).--Chris Ryland----------------------------------Mail-from: Arpanet host SRI-CSL rcvd at 4-DEC-82 1711-PSTMail-from: ARPANET host SANDIA rcvd at 1-Dec-82 0026-PSTMail-from: ARPANET site SU-SCORE rcvd at 1-Dec-82 0126-MSTMail-from: SU-NET host Shasta rcvd at 1-Dec-82 0026-PSTDate: Wednesday,  1 Dec 1982 00:25-PSTTo: Randy Frank <FRANK at UTAH-20>Cc: mark.umcp-cs at UDEL-RELAY, info-vax at SANDIASubject: Re: inexpensive laser printersIn-reply-to: Your message of  1 Dec 1982 0040-MST.From: Brian Reid <reid%Shasta at SU-Score>Remailed-date:  4 Dec 1982 1047-PSTRemailed-from: the tty of Geoffrey S.

Text may be positioned at arbitrary  absolute positions, and it can draw vertical and horizontal lines  of nearly any width (no diagonals, though).  It's resolution of  300 dots/inch is identical to the 9700's.--At 12 pages/min, it is rather more than marginally faster than a  double-daisy printer.  It is also faster than the Canon LPB-10  which is spec'd at 10 pages/min.--At $19K, I believe it is the least expensive of the currently available  choices.  More interestingly, it can be leased it for about $600/month,  plus a page charge after 5000 copies.  This includes the same kind of  quick-response maintenance that Xerox provides for their copiers.On the other hand, here are our most serious complaints about the 2700:--Xerox refuses to provide detailed technical information about such things  as font file formats.  (If anybody manages to figure out how to create  new fonts, we'd sure like to hear about it.)--The apparent inability to download bitmap graphics is most unfortunate.--The limits on number of fonts/page and overall page complexity imposed  by the device's memory limitations may turn out to be a problem, but we're  not sure yet.As for advice:  I completely agree that now is not quite thetime to buy a bottom of the line laser printer.  In this regard, theability to lease the 2700 and to have Xerox maintain it is the best thingthat machine has going for it.After surveying our options, our decision was to lease a 2700 ona fairly short-term basis, and to wait until something better comes along.					-Pete Lucas------------------------------------------------------------*start*08516 00024 US Mail-from: Arpanet host MIT-MC rcvd at 26-NOV-82 1420-PSTMail-from: ARPANET host SANDIA rcvd at 26-Nov-82 0901-PSTMail-from: ARPANET site SU-SCORE rcvd at 26-Nov-82 1003-MSTMail-from: SU-NET host Shasta rcvd at 26-Nov-82 0901-PSTDate: Friday, 26 Nov 1982 08:50-PSTTo: mark.umcp-cs at Udel-RelayCc: info-vax at SandiaSubject: inexpensive laser printersFrom: Brian Reid <reid@Shasta at SU-Score>Remailed-date: 26 Nov 1982 1322-PSTRemailed-from: the tty of Geoffrey S. Goodfellow  <Geoff5 at SRI-CSL>Remailed-to: info-printers at MIT-MCThis is a slightly premature time to buy an inexpensive laser printer,because the availability of good printers on the market is going to getquite a bit better soon. Let me tell you, though, what is available now.But first some background information.A laser printing system consists of a marking engine, an interface thatcan operate that marking engine, and a set of supporting software,including fonts, conversion programs, and so forth.There are only 2 marking engines available in commercial products inthe U.S. today; all of the laser printers that are available are builtout of these. The first is the Canon LBP-10, the second is the XeroxXP-12. The LBP-10 is a wet-toner system, capable of rectangular pixels480/inch horizontally by 240/inch vertically. The Xerox XP-12 is adry-toner system, capable of round pixels 384/inch apart, but deliveredfrom Xerox configured for 300/inch. All printer products that areavailable today built around the LBP-10 print 2 rectangles per pixel,giving an effective "spot size" of 240/inch; all printer products thatare available today built around the XP-12 operate it at about300/inch. The XP-12 is essentially a Xerox 3300 copier, with a laserscanner and a small amount of electronics added. I do not know theCanon copier model number to which the LBP-10 is equivalent.Wet process gives extremely good image resolution and good contrast;dry process is capable of being faster, and is substantially cheaper tooperate. It is possible to tune a dry-process system to give resolutionand contrast that is just as good as a wet-process system, but theyseem to drift out of tune more quickly. Wet-process imaging systemsgive of noxious fumes (primarily a chemical called Isopar-G), andshould not be operated in a room where people work. Dry-process imagingsystems do not give off fumes, but there has been some controversy overthe toxicity of the toner particles. Essentially all high-end copiersthat you have seen, such as Xerox and IBM and Kodak, use dry-processimaging; many low-end copiers use wet process.I have seen prototypes of numerous fantastic new marking engines,primarily of Japanese manufacture, that are a lot better than either ofthese devices, but I am not aware of any currently-available printingsystem that uses any of the next-generation marking engines yet; theymight hit the market in about a year if everything goes right.Very well; time to get on to the printers that are available made outof these components.2 companies currently offer printing systems made out of the LBP-10.Symbolics, of Cambridge Mass, offers a system based on their LM-2processor. The Symbolics system costs something like $24K, as I recall,and has extremely good software support for various printing formats,including those used by TRoff, TeX, and Scribe. The Symbolics systemcan connect to your computer over its line-printer interface, which isreasonably fast, and can also use Chaosnet or Ethernet links atadditional cost. I have never seen an official statement from Symbolicsabout the fonts that come with the printer and/or can be bought withit, but the Symbolics printers that I have seen sported a largecollection of fonts gleaned from a wide variety of sources; I wassomewhat suspicious as to the copyright status of some of them.Imagen, of Palo Alto CA, offers an LBP-10 system based on the Sunprocessor. The Imagen printer was designed to be a TeX printer, thoughit can print TRoff output (at substantially degraded quality) by meansof a conversion program. A Scribe option is recently available thatpermits Scribe to generate files for the Imagen Canon. The Imagen Canonconnects to its host computer over a 9600-baud terminal line. My lab atStanford has 2 Imagen Canons, and we have had no end of trouble withthem, and have had absolutely zero luck in getting any support out ofImagen even though they are right in the same city as us. The softwareis unbelievably flaky; about every 4th time I go to print a file on itI have to go power-cycle the controller because the firmware haswedged. Nevertheless, the thing does more or less work, and continuesto work without maintenance, which is a good thing given that we can'tfind anybody to maintain it or teach us how to maintain it. Thesoftware development person recently at Imagen is an old friend ofmine, and he recently promised me that "things are going to get better".We have contemplated trading in our Imagen Canons for Symbolics Canons,but if we did that we'd still just have Canon LBP-10 printers, whicharen't wonderful enough to make that cross-country trade worth thehassle. I have no experience with Symbolics support and maintenance,but I have a hard time believing that it is as bad as Imagen.4 companies currently make printers out of the Xerox XP-12, but none ofthose offerings is entirely satisfactory. Xerox Printing Systems makestheir model 2700 laser printer by adding an 8086-based controller and acouple of fonts to the XP-12. It is my opinion that Xerox has nobusiness calling the 2700 a laser printer, because it doesn't reallyoffer any more functionality than a double-daisy printer, and ismarginally faster. The 2-page ads that Xerox takes out in ScientificAmerican in which it implies that the 2700 is somehow a slower versionof their 9700 printer (third of a million dollars and worth every pennyof it) are bordering on fraud; the 2700 is completely unsatisfactoryfor any text processing application. DEC sells the equivalent of the2700, and calls it the LN01, but doesn't try to pretend that it is afull-capability laser printer. I have also heard that Wang makes aproduct out of the XP-12, and I would assume that it is functionallysimilar to the 2700, which is to say it is a monofont word processingprinter.Xerox Office Systems makes their 8045 printer out of the XP-12 also.The 8045 is a real printer; it can print pretty much arbitrarycombinations of text and graphics. Nevertheless, there are severalreasons why it is not the printer that you want. The first reason isthat Xerox won't really sell you one. Or at least they wouldn't sell meone. Whenever I have asked about buying an 8045, the salesman told methat they wouldn't sell me one unless I bought some number of Starworkstations. The second reason is that the 8045 is expensive; it comeswith a full Star processor and a 40-megabyte disk. The price that wasquoted to me in July 82 was around $40K. The third reason that youdon't want an 8045 is that Xerox refuses to divulge the file format forit. The 8045 uses a file format called Interpress, which is extremelynice and wonderfully general and all that, but you will have to resortto industrial espionage if you want to find out how to make files inInterpress format, and my spies at Xerox tell me there is not muchchance of that changing.There is a company somewhere in the southeast, Atlanta I believe,called Quality Micro Systems, that offers a printer built out of theXP-12. They showed it at the Siggraph conference in Boston in June (Idid not attend). I am not aware of any QMS printers having beendelivered to customers, and I haven't got a clue as to what QMS isgoing to do for software and fonts; I consider it quite unlikely thatQMS will come up with anything that I want to buy anytime in the next12 months.The bottom line is that if you want a printer right now, you should buya Symbolics Canon or an Imagen Canon. Based on my own personalexperience I would strongly recommend that you go with Symbolicsinstead of Imagen, but the Imagen is cheaper. I am sufficientlyfrustrated by all of this that I am building my own printer out of theXP-12, but it will be at least 6 months before my printer and itsassociated interfaces and software are up and running, and another 6months to a year before somebody is able to manufacture copies of it.		Brian Reid		Stanford*start*07700 00024 US Date: 18 Jan. 1983 11:33 am PST (Tuesday)From: Putz.paSubject: Re: Digital Image Data CompressionIn-reply-to: GWilliams' message of 13 Jan. 1983 2:26 pm PST (Thursday)To: GWilliamscc: Putz, Krasner, IngallsI have done a little experimenting, and have come up with a tentativecompressed bitmap file format.  Please give me any reactions or suggestions to theinformation below.Background-----------We basically deal with four kinds of digital images in SCG:1.  Smalltalk screen images (1024 x 808 x 1) or subsets thereof.  These normallyhave a halftone gray background and several windows containing mostly text.2.  Bitmap images composed in the Smalltalk Form Editor (up to 1024 x 680 x 1). These are mostly hand-drawn, and vary greatly in content and style.3.  AIS images from a Jasmine scanner (up to 700 x 900 x 8 @ 85 samples/inch). Many of these are of black-and-white material, and are thresholded to increasecontrast.4.  Bitmap images scanned by a TC200 telecopier (2016 x 2600 x 1 @ 239samples/inch).  Many of these will be scanned text, for character recognition. The TC200 can also be used as a printer.My latest interest in data compression is for the TC200 output, but while I'm atit, I would like to tackle the problem for our other digital images.File Formats In Use-------------------We currently use the following encodings and file formats:".form" format:	A 4 word header containing:		1		-- specifies ".form" format		width		-- bits per scan line		height	-- number of scan lines		offset x	-- the form origin offset, usually zero,		offset y	    sometimes negative (two's-complement).	Followed by height * floor ((width + 15) / 16) words of data.	Each scan line is padded to the next word boundary."Form storeOn:" encoding (used by the Smalltalk Galley Editor):	A Smalltalk (text) expression which, when evaluated, creates a Form	object.  e.g.:		(Form extent: 300@200			fromCompactArray: #(		'scan line 1 run-encoded as a string'		'scan line 2 run-encoded as a string'		...etc...		'scan line 200 run-encoded as a string'		)			offset: 0@0)	Of course, the actual strings contain arbitrary characters with values from	0 to 255.  Occurances of the single quote character are doubled.  The run	encoding used is:		For consecutive runs of any byte value, <0> <count> <value>.		For a single non-zero byte value,	<value>		For a single zero byte,			<0> <0>".ais" format (generated by Jasmine scan program):	AIS File format is described in detail elsewhere.  The AIS files we use	have a 1024 word header, are UCA (Uncompressed Array) coding type,	contain 8 bits/sample, and are unblocked.  The beginning of the header	looks like:		AIS password	(102252b)		header length	(1024)		type | length	(1 bitShift: 10) + 10		scanCount		scanLength		scanDir		(3)		samples/pixel	(1)		coding type		(1 = UCA)		bits/sample		(8)		words/SL		(scanCount/2)		SL/block		(-1 = no blocking)		padding/block	(-1 = no blocking)		0			(end of header parts)	The data starts at word 1024 and consists of sequential scan lines	containing scanCount bytes each.".bits" format (generated by TC200 scan program):	I don't know what the header format is.  All I know is that the header is	14 pages (of 256 words) long.  The data is divided into 32 page blocks.	Since the image is 2016 bits wide (126 words), there are two words of	padding at the end of each block of 65 scan lines.  There appear to be	about 2600 scan lines.	Note that this bears no relation to the Versatec Plotter ".bits" format.	Is this similar to the format of "Press.bits"?	I would like to know what the complete file format is.Data Compression Statistics--------------------------I have experimented with some different run-encoding schemes.The "Form storeOn:" encoding appears to give a compression ratio of about 1.4(30% savings) when applied to Form Editor forms (Dan's measurements).A binary version of the same compression scheme does slightly better at about1.72 (42% savings).If the byte <174> is used instead of <0> to indicate a run, the compression goesup to 1.78 (44%).If I use your trick of xoring each scan line with the previous one, the ratio is1.87 (47%).Combining the xor trick and using <174> instead of <0> gives a compression ratioof 1.96 (49% savings).I then tried a different run-encoding which is more like the one you described. It only encodes solid black and white runs.  The main difference is that it is stillbyte oriented.	Runs of <0> or <255> bytes are encoded as	<flag> <colorBit|count>.	Actual flag bytes are represented by		<flag> <0>.	All other bytes simply occur as			<value>.Using <0> as the flag gives a compression (on the same data) of 1.83 (45%).Using <174> as the flag gives 1.89 (47%).Using xoring and a <0> flag gives 2.01 (50%).Using xoring and a <174> flag gives the best result so far, 2.11 (53% savings).On another set of forms (mostly portions of Smalltalk screens), this last methodgave a compression of 2.74 (64% savings).On a page of text scanned with the TC200, the ratio was about 8:1 (87%), whileon a complicated drawing, only about 5:1 (80%).Note that Glenn Krasner found that straight run-encoding, always using twobytes per run, gives about 1.5 compression (33% savings).I would be interested in running your compression algorithm over some of thisdata and comparing the results.  I didn't implement your algorithm because of itscomplexity, but if it performs much better it might be worth it.A Compressed Bitmap File Format---------------------------------I have tentatively designed a file format using the last compression algorithmmentioned above.  It is based on the AIS File format:		AIS password	(102252b)		header length	(12)		type | length	(1 bitShift: 10) + 9		scanCount		scanLength		scanDir		(3)		samples/pixel	(1)		coding type		(2 = Compressed Array?)		bits/sample		origin x		origin y		0			(end of header parts)The run-encoded data starts at word "header length".  As in the previousencodings, the scan lines are always padded to the next even byte beforerun-encoding, but the run-encoded scan line is not padded (i.e. scan lines maystart on odd bytes).The origin x and origin y words are two's-complement integers which are thenegative of the offset values in the ".form" format.I have also designed an optional "scan line index" part for the header, allowingmore efficient access to portions of the data without decoding all previous scanlines:		type | length	(5 bitShift: 10) + length		increment (k)		scan 1 length	number of bytes in first scan line encoding		scan k+1 length	number of bytes in k+1st scan line encoding		scan 2k+1 length	...		...etc...See AIS File documentation for complete syntax of AIS File headers.A typical index increment (k) might be 16.Compressing 8-bit AIS Images-----------------------------By leaving in the bits/sample entry, this scheme could be used for 8 bit/sampleAIS files also, although based on some very limited experiments, I was surprisedto find that the compression obtained was only about 1.45 (31%) and moreoverthat the results were slightly better (1.48, 32%) when the xor trick was not used.Since many of our AIS images are heavily thresholded anyway, I am consideringreducing them to 4 bits/sample.  Not only will this immediately cut the amountof data in half, but the run properties should improve quite a lot, since "noise" isremoved from the data.  This should give an overall compression ratio of 4 or 5.I would also be interested in other compression schemes which do better on thiskind of data.*start*00836 00024 US Received: from MIT-MC.ARPA by PARC-MAXC.ARPA; 24 JAN 83 10:31:46 PSTReturn-path: <@MIT-MC:ACUFF@RUTGERS>Date: 24 Jan 1983 1309-ESTFrom: Rich Acuff at Ohio State <Acuff@RUTGERS>Subject: Three laser printers.To: Info-Printers@MIT-MC   At Ohio State we are considering three laser printers: The Xerox2700, The Symbolics LGP, and the Imagen Imprint 10.

The Xerox 2700 uses the same print engine as the Xerox Star, buthas an entirely different interface, which is said to be a "loser".It is said to be designed (more or less) as a line printer replacement(presumably for printing business reports, etc.)  You cannot defineyour own fonts, although Xerox will sell you multiple fonts.2. Both the Symbolics LGP-1 (Laser Graphics Printer 1), and theImagen IMPRINT-10 are based on the same print engine (sold to OEM'sby Canon.)  It has a resolution of 240 dots per inch, which is theminimum that is usable.  Both Imagen and Symbolics build an interfacebased on a M68000, to convert reasonable input (ASCII characters andfont information, etc.) into the video signal required by the printengine.  The two interfaces (of course) interact with the host computerusing different protocols and different print file formats.We have three laser printers on campus:  an IBM 6670, an Imprint-10, andan LGP-1, so I will give a few impressions of each.3. The IBM 6670 is given to the user by IBM with minimum font support.You can drive it from your 370 using the Script formatter.  The 6670will hold 4 fonts, and you must define the entire font.  Fonts canonly be defined at the beginning of a page (and underlined text is aseparate font!)  The 6670 will accept normal line printer input withANSI carriage control.  (E.g., it will automatically convert overprintingusing "+" in column 1 to bold face.)  IBM does not support user definedfonts, but it turns out that you can build your own font files if youwant to.  The print quality is quite good, comparable to the Xerox 2700,I would say.  (This machine belongs to the Computation Center, and Idon't know much about it.)4. The Imprint-10.  Imagen has been selling these longer than Symbolics,and they make much of the fact that they have lots of "field experience"with their product.  The Imprint-10 will take Metafont fonts.  (Metafontprovides the Canon as an output device option.)  They provide C programsthat are supposed to convert CAT files to their IMPRESS format.  Theyare intended to work on a VAX; I don't know how well they work on aDEC-20.  (After having a student spend some time trying to bring them upon the 20, we got the Imprint-10 driver for Scribe, and use thatdirectly.)  There is a DEC-20 program to convert TeX DVI files toIMPRESS format.  We have only tried the convert on a few DVI files; itworked on some, but broke on others.  I don't know the details.  Theyalso provide a program that will convert an ASCII file to print in anarbitrary font.At the moment you can only drive the printer over an RS-232 line(maximum speed is 9600 baud, I believe.  That is as fast as we can go,anyway.)  They provide a program that will check to see if the printer'sTTY line is free, and (if so) assigns it, sends a file to the printer,and then deassigns the TTY line.  This requires the user to wait untilthe printer is free, and actually run the job himself.  We havedeveloped a TOPS-20 spooler that runs under QUASAR, with an interfacesimilar to the PRINT command. Imagen plans to produce an Ethernetinterface "sometime this spring."[Side note: We have experienced intermittent print job errors ever sincewe got the spooler up.  This has finally been diagnosed after severalcalls to Imagen, and some prodding.  Every IMPRESS file starts with a"job name", which is documented as an ASCIZ string, and serves nofunction other than to be printed out on the Imprint-10's console.  Nostring length limitation is mentioned in the documentation.  Imagenfinally informed us that the string should be no longer than 50 charactersor it would overwrite something in memory.  None of our job names werelonger than 50 characters, but cutting the limit to 10 characters didappear to solve the problem.]5. The Symbolics LGP-1.  We have one of these, also connected to aDEC-20.  The interface and file format are somewhat simpler than theImagen, but (over the RS-232 interface) you cannot get the printerstatus.  They have a built-in fonts that allow you to use the LGP-1 asa line printer with 82 lines per page.  Currently the LGP-1 will acceptgraphics output intended for a Tektronix graphics terminal, and printit.  They also say they will support Diablo and GSI CAT formats, but Idon't know whether that will be in the device itself, or whether theyintend to put filters on the host.  The LGP-1 offers Centronics and Unibus interfaces, also.  We are usingthe RS-232 interface, because the printer is remote from the centralsite.  They take a straight byte stream (unlike the Imprint-10, whichuses a packetized stream with acknowledgements to build a reliable bytestream), and we have not experienced any problems with this scheme.  Ibelieve that over the other interfaces the host can get statusinformation from the printer.  (Certainly their LISP machines get statusback from the printer, and they go through the UNIBUS connection.)Symbolics is small company started by some people from the MIT AI Lab.They got a bunch of venture capital to build LISP machines.  The LGP-1is another product, and their board of directors would not let them sellthe LGP-1 separately from the LISP machines until they could arrange anadequate maintenance network.  I believe that they have arranged to haveGeneral Instruments or TRW do the local maintenance.Unilogic is supposed to provide Scribe support for the LGP-1 sometimesoon.  We are driving it from Impress files and DVI files using an ELISPdriver to do the conversion.The Symbolics machine appears to have slightly more font memory than theImprint-10.Symbolics intends to produce an Ethernet interface sometime "thisspring".  [Side note: We received the Symbolics LPG-1 early, curtesy of our localsales rep.  We called their expert in Cambridge, and he gave usinstructions on installation over the phone.  It took about 30 minutes,and was no problem.  Imagen had an installer come in to unpack and setup their beast.  The Imprint-10 installation does involve installingtheir interface boards, as well as setting up the print engine.  Unlikethe Symbolics boards, which fit into the Canon cabinet, the Imagenboards are based on the SUN processor, and are a different size,requiring a small box be attached to the printer cabinet.]6. There was a rumor that Symbolics and/or Imagen is looking around fora higher resolution print engine, but I have not heard that directly.7. DEC's LN01 is based on the same Xerox print engine as the 2700 andthe Star print server.  Xerox OEM's the engine to DEC and Wang, who thenbuild their own interfaces and resell it.  I don't know anything aboutthe quality of these interfaces.8. Brian Reid of Stanford has designed a new interface for that sameprint engine.  It drives the printer at 400 dots per inch.  (The Xeroxinterfaces only drive it at only 300 dots per inch, because they can'tgenerate the video to keep up at 400 dots per inch.)  There is apossibility that this may become a product, and become generallyavailable.   It will take PRESS file format as input.9. Delfax (a Canadian company) makes an "ion deposition" print engine.It is rated at 240 dots per inch, but output does not look nearly asgood as the Canon printers.  However, this beast does produce 60 pagesper minute.  They want to OEM this printer to someone who will build aninterface for it.  Last summer they were talking with Symbolics, morerecently I heard they were talking to BBN.The price info I have is:  retail for the LGP-1 is $25K retail, andslightly over $23K to universities.  The Imprint-10 is $29K retail, and$24,900 to universities with 50% down and 50% net 30 days.  I don't knowabout the rest.-- Rich*start*02535 00024 US Received: from MIT-MC.ARPA by PARC-MAXC.ARPA; 12 FEB 83 05:15:41 PSTReturn-path: <@MIT-MC:imagen!cpr@Berkeley>Date: 12 Feb 83 05:08:15 PST (Sat)From: imagen!cpr@Berkeley.ARPAMessage-Id: <8301121308.23995@UCBVAX.BERKELEY.ARPA>Received: by UCBVAX.BERKELEY.ARPA (3.300 [1/17/83])	id AA23995; 12 Feb 83 05:08:15 PST (Sat)To: acuff@rutgers.ARPA, cmp.cohen@utexas-20.ARPA, info-printers@mc.ARPARich:  A few corrections from an IMAGEN employee.  You're comparing with theold IMAGEN (release 0) product; the new (release 1) product, which wasannounced publicly last week, completely changes the comparison basis.    At the moment you can only drive the printer over an RS-232 line...    Imagen plans to produce an Ethernet interface "sometime this spring."The IMPRINT-10 can be driven over a serial line, with various protocols(packetized, error-correcting/detecting; serial xon/xoff or rts/cts;simpler packet, error-detecting protocol (again, xon/xoff or rts/cts); etc),a Centronics parallel interface, a DEC DR-11C or DR-11W interface,an IBM 2780/3780 bisynch interface, or an Ethernet 10MB, TCP/IP interface.The IMPRINT-10 can accept documents in a variety of forms, currentlyImpress (a page-layout language with full graphics, including polygondraw with various pen widths, polygon fill with arbitrary texture, graphicsplane magnification (useful with bitmap screen copies, etc.), and all fourvirtual page orientations), Tektronix 4014 (tm), Diablo (tm),line printer (1- and 2-up, landscape and portrait), and others.    The Symbolics machine appears to have slightly more font memory than the    Imprint-10.Not true if you get the 1MB memory option for the IMPRINT-10; thenthey're about equal.    6. There was a rumor that Symbolics and/or Imagen is looking around for    a higher resolution print engine, but I have not heard that directly.All I can say is that IMAGEN is indeed building a compatible familyof printers with a range of resolutions and speeds.    The price info I have is:  retail for the LGP-1 is $25K retail, and    slightly over $23K to universities.  The Imprint-10 is $29K retail, and    $24,900 to universities with 50% down and 50% net 30 days.The IMPRINT-10 now has a base price of $17,500, with software and hardwareoptions added from there; you can add memory, resident fonts,communications interfaces, languages (e.g., Impress).(The base price gets you a printing system with one simpleemulator, viz. line printer, Diablo, or screen dump.)*start*00608 00024 US Date: 16 Feb 1983 05:05 PSTFrom: GWilliams at PARC-MAXCSubject: Press version 4.6 is releasedTo: Kim, SEK@SU-AI, Dale.EOS, Hunt, ISL^.pa, Orr, DBrown cc:  GNelson, Swinehart, Wilhelm, Ramshaw, GWilliamsReply-To: GWilliamsPress 4.6 is available on [Maxc]<Press>:	Press.Run, Press.Syms, AND Press.Errors.Press behaves rather interestingly when outputting a very large number of dots. Rounding errors occur that can cause the appearance of a few undesirable scanlines at the bottom of a print.This happened while I was on vacation; Lyle found and fixed the problem.Glen*start*00983 00024 US Date: 11 Feb. 1983 10:41 am PST (Friday)From: Ramshaw.PASubject: Press statusTo: GWilliamscc: Larson, RamshawGlen, Eric and Gary S. came to me this week with a Press problem, which Itracked down to an inadequacy in the technique used for magnifying orreducing bitmaps.

I hope that you, as officialPress maintainer, can help us with a new release, if necessary.  I realize thatPress is old code and that it not easy to make new releases, but this problemcauses quite a lot of problems with our server operations.Whenever Press runs into a problem (printer not ready, out of paper, etc.) itdisplays the letters K0, K1, K2, etc.  It then waits until the problem has beencorrected and tries again.  When it does try again, it always prints out garbage. We have never seen it recover successfully from a K# error.  In addition, itcontinues to spew out garbage pages until the Alto is rebooted.The problem gets worse with our current printer server arrangement.  We havetwo Altos connected to the same 6500 printer.  When one Alto is printing and theother Alto tries to print at the same time, the second Alto K0's.  After the firstAlto finishes printing, the second Alto sets the printer lines high and leavesthem on, causing the printer spew out garbage pages until someone manuallyintervenes.  These collisions are happening more and more frequently and arecausing many headaches.It seems to me that there are several possible ways of fixing the problem.  1) Fix the error recovery mechanism so that Press recovers properly when thereis a collision.  This is probably not an easy task.  2) Copy a command file (Press.cm?) into Rem.cm and boot.  This clears the Slotlines and lets Press try again.  We would probably put the command "PressReprint; @Server.cm@" into our command file.  3) Not try to fix the error recovery mechanism, but at least clear the Slot linesso that the printer doesn't continue to spew out garbage pages.How about it?  Is there any possibility that you could fix this problem for us?Many thanks.Keith------------------------------------------------------------*start*00263 00024 US Date: 4 March 1983 12:24 pm PST (Friday)From: GWilliams.PASubject: Re: request for Press workIn-reply-to: Your message of 3 March 1983 10:29 am PST (Thursday)To: Ramshawcc: GWilliamsI'll look into it, and send him a message.Glen*start*00604 00024 US Date: 4 March 1983 12:32 pm PST (Friday)From: GWilliams.PASubject: Press K0To: Knox.wbstcc: GWilliams, RamshawAre you running a 6500 from a SLOT card?  We have similar problems witholder SLOT cards in that they don't return status to the Alto.The Alto will hold print request high as a result of the SLOT not returningstatus (i.e., the code tries to reset, but the microcode is unsuccessful).  It thenthinks an error happened that had no relation to the printer (such as diskerrors).  If you could tell me more about your exact configuration, it would helpme.Glen*start*01265 00024 US Date: 4 March 1983 7:02 pm EST (Friday)From: Knox.wbstSubject: Re: Press K0In-reply-to: GWilliams.PA's message of 4 March 1983 12:32 pm PST (Friday)To: GWilliams.PAcc: Knox, Ramshaw.PAGlen,Yes, we are running the 6500 from a SLOT card.  The 6500 is also equipped witha HESSO laser scanner.  Our SLOT cards have been around for a long time, so Iassume that they are some of the older ones.  Are you saying that the newerones (perhaps ones that Gary has built) don't have this problem?We used to run the 6500 from a single Alto, but we now have two Alto's (eachwith their own SLOT card) and a Perkin-Elmer computer connected to theprinter.  The Perkin-Elmer doesn't have any problem with collisions.  It justwaits until the printer says that it is ready and then it prints.  However, whenone of the Alto's tries to print when the printer is busy and doesn't becomeready before the Alto times out, the Press software K0's and cannot seem torecover.A printer being driven by only one Alto (as I assume that yours are) would notreally be bothered by this inability to recover, since it would happen veryinfrequently.  Unfortunately, in our system it happens more often and requiresmanual intervention to correct.Keith*start*01086 00024 US Date: 7 April 1983 2:35 pm PST (Thursday)From: Evans.EOSSubject: Alto/Raven Print ServerTo: AllDLOS^.dlos, AllEOS^.eos, AllES^.es, AllHENR^.henr, AllLB^.lb, AllPA^.pa, AllRX^.rx, AllWBST^.wbst, AllXRCC^.xrcc,ALLDC^.dc, AllSTHQ^.STHQReply-To: EvansIf you have no need for an Alto/Raven Press Print Server please disregard thismessage.EOS is going to begin a build of an interface board that attachs a Raven (used inthe 2700 and the 8044) printer to an Alto.

I tried to reach you by phoneyesterday and today, but missed you.  I'll try to reach you before I leave forEurope.In any case, try it, play with it, and let me know if our communications brokedown anywhere.  I'm sending source and the .com file.  The file to run isXCPTest.com.  It doesn't type a "hello" message.  It immediately tries to put themachine through a power-up cycle.After that, it types a message that says to type a "W" when the fuser is warm.At that point, it loops waiting on Page request.  Note that for that to work, thePage request line should be routed through a flip-flop.  That hardware isn't onmy board so I tricked it up by holding ground then +5 to P3B4.On receipt of the page request, the code should print a page then go back andlook for page request again.  The code is in there to do repeated pages withoutshutting down.If you want to recompile the code, compile XCPTest.c.  It's a little tricky to do onan Apple, and I wouldn't suggest it unless you can't resist.By the way, 4-color Press works.Hope to catch you before I leave.Glen*start*10236 00024 US Date: 11 April 1983 1:07 pm PST (Monday)From: Evans.EOSSubject: Alto/Raven Print ServerTo: Kelly.ES,rutkaus.lb,jcastro.es,BHardy.RX,Shookm.dlos,GYoung.PA,Hirst.RX, Coleman.Wbst,hewitt.henr,dgustafson.XRCC,rlcampbell.ES,KAHRS.PA,VCornyn.es, BELLI.WBST,Reilly.escc: Orr.PA,Evans,DonStewart,GWilliams.PA The following paragraphs give the details on the Raven Interface and itsoperation. In the past I have found that not everybody is aware of all the detailsand differences of some of the systems we use.  Therefore I included somegeneral information on printing to answer some of the questions you may have. (Sorry that it made this so long.)Alto Configuration:The Alto may be either an Orbit or regular back plame machine.  If it isnormally used to run Spruce the Orbit boards must be pull out (at least an inch)for Press/Raven operation.  Likewise the Raven board must be pulled loose forOrbit operation. If the Alto has an Orbit backplane there cannot be a Tridentmux installed as there are not enough slots then for the interface.Alto Disk Requirments:The Alto must have one Model 31 and either a T300 or T80 Trident.  We havenot been able to operate the unit with the Shugart that is used in some Spruceconfigurations.Press vs. Spruce Printing:The Penguin runs as a Spruce printer.  This means that it will spool input, i.e.,it backs up printing jobs in a queue and the formation of the image is done inreal time during the printing of a page.  This formation of the image is done bya four board set, Orbit, which take the character bit maps from the Alto memoryand "ors" them in real time.  Thus all bit maps of the characters must be in theAlto memory before the printing of the page starts.  Even then, for complexpages, the unit gets behind which causes a breakup in the output.  If not all ofthe bit maps requried can be placed in the Alto memory you get a "Page TooComplex" message.  Before starting the printing of a page Spruce orders the pressfile contents into a "Band List" so that it may read the directions for printingduring the time the image is transferred to the engine.Press differs from Spruce in that:  One, it does not Spool its input--it requires thepress file to present on the Model 31.  Two, it does not form the the image inreal time, rather it makes up the image first on the Trident in a file callPress.bits.  Since this opertion is not time dependent there is no such thing as atoo complex page for a press printer.  However, note that during the time thatPress.bits is being formed the Alto does nothing else--this is the reason there isno spooling available, also that the formation of the image on disk is muchslower than the use of an Orbit.The nonreal time operation of Press/Slot prints slows things down and one doesnot get the 12 pages per min except during a reprint or during the time that thepaper is going through the engine.  The times to print a document are closer tothose you get with Star than with Spruce.Press Server:To operate Press in a server mode we use a command file that runs EFTP till adocument is received as Temp.press. Then a short program called DeSpruce is urnto remove the spruce headers from BravoX documents (if you do not use BravoXthis could be removed). The last command in the file is for the running of pressto print Temp.press.  The server is thus not available to another user untill itgets back into EFTP after the current printing.If the doucment is Empress'ed the number of copies asked for will be printed.however, if it is a BravoX document and printed from within BravoX, only onecopy will be printed.The output does not have the cover sheets that Spruce puts on the front of a job.Press Server Speed:About the best we have ever seen for the running of Despruce and Pressproduction of one page is 40 seconds.  The worst time for one page was a page ofmusic that took 20 minutes (it did not use any fonts only splines).  In generalthe time depends not only on the number of pages printed but their complexity. If you would like me to print one of your press files and send you the times letme know.Press Software:The unit uses the current version of Press with a very minor mod to themicrocode to reset the board.  Everything is available on [Rosebowl].  Adocument on the operation of press named "Pressops.press" may be available onyour local file server.  If not, then try [Rosebowl]Altodocs>pressops.press. Further questions on this form of Press should be sent to GWilliams at PARC.Image Printing:The Press/Raven can print AIS files if they are on the Trident.  The onlydifficulty we have had with this is that under some unknown conditions Presscannot rotate some images and you must use AisRotate.Raven Printer (876):The Raven is the engine that is used in the 2700 and the 8044/8045 NS servers. It is a 300 dot per inch, 12 page per min unit.  From what I have seen, the 2700form has the offset stacker and the 8000 form does not.  At EOS we have onlyused the 8000 form which has the product ID of 876.  Note that the print times donot include setup time of the server before it starts printing.Raven Quality:The Raven does not produce as good of quality as a Penguin in most cases. Large black areas are usually very poor. I have seen this cause poor edges when36 point fonts are used.  Our experience has also been that the unit tend to varyquite bit in just how well they do.  Sopmetimes just stiring the toner can make alot of difference (had to call the repair person out to find that out).  In generalwe find that for the cost you cannot complain--8044 users don't.Raven Availability:We have obtained 6 of the Ravens from OPD (or who ever they are now).  Oncethey figured out how to do the paperwork for a stand alone printer it took about3 weeks ARO. One Raven has come from WBST without going through the OPDroute and it took about the same amount of time.  (Beware that the local OPDpeople may not understand a non server printer and can hold up the paperwork--our first order took 4 months.)Raven Costs:The cost from OPD has been about $4478.  It was less form WBST.Raven Resolution and Fonts:The standard Raven is a 300 dot per inch printer.  Press will support thisresolution by setting the parameter when Press/i is done.  However, EOS is usingthe printer like a Penguin and wanted to use the fonts that we normally usewith our Penguin/Spruce server.  To do this we change the crystal and reset thebit clock switches in the Raven so that the bit clock and polygon run at the rateof a 384 dot per inch printer (Penguin).  (This increases the address ability ofthe unit not its true resolution.)  In this way a copy of the Spruce.fonts can beused for Press.fonts and we get the full set of fonts.  However, we have foundthat the extended set of fonts used in Bravox, e.g., the Em space, does not printusing the Press software. The modifications to the Raven take about 15 min andare reversable.Raven Service:Even with the modifications installed in the Raven our local branch of the 8044maintainers will service the printer.  They do require that you be able to print awhite page, a black page and some form of font output. We keep these press fileson our unit at all times.  We have never had a failure that required thechanging of the boards that were modified--in which case the crystal wouldneed to be swaped or the switches changed on the the new one.  Note that forservice Press can be set for 300 spots per inch and unmodified boards run.Interface Board:The board we use was designed at PARC and is refered to as the 64K Slot.  Itoperates in the same fashion as the older slot card. It has two line buffers whichare alternated during the printing.  The bits fed to the buffers are those that willbe placed on the page, i.e., it does not modify the video. It is designed usingsome ECL chips so that the max output ;rate is far above that need for a Raven.Control of the Raven is by a microporcessor on the board that converts the singlelines of a slot card to the ASCII like communication of the Raven Five WireInterface.  Provision also exists on the board to drive almost any type of slot typeof interface via the position of jumpers (both ECL and TTL type are supported).More information on the use of the board for other than the Raven should beaddressed to Orr.PA.Board Construction:Up to now the construction has been StitchWeld.  However the number of boardshas been growing so the board will be moved to PC which will be much betterfor a large number of users.  The current build will be by EOS, with PARCmanaging the conversion to PC.Board Availability:The conversion to PC has just started so we expect to start loading and testingthe boards in 6 to 8 weeks.  The problem with this is that we need to orderparts--to order parts I need to know how many we are going to build.  Thus thiscycle of seting the number could add a few weeks to the time.Baord Price:The price will be acutal costs.  For the Stitch Weld versions, with Raven cable,this was about $1300 to $1400.  The cost of going to PC will be divided among allof the boards and may raise the costs.  We feel that the advantages of PC areenough to allow the price to be higher.  (One SW board we placed has alreadyhad the wires damaged and the repair takes quite a bit of time.)A reasonable transfer agreement would state "not to exceed $2000 per board".  Wewill try to keep the cost as low as possible.Board to Raven Cable:We will supply any cable beyond that supplied with the Raven that may berequired.Board Repair:EOS is placing these boards outside of Xerox and will maintain the board forsometime to come on an actual cost basis. However understand that we will dothis when "time is available" so there may not be a fast turnaround.Board Spares:If you need the unit to operate at all times it would be best to consider orderinga spare.  We do not intend to have keep a supply of boards at EOS.Future Builds:None are planned at the present time. ----------I hope that I have covered most of the details.

It was a conference about automated systems for doing page make-up. These are known in the publishing industry as pagination systems.The 50 or so attendees were a mixture of people directly involved in printing and publishing and representatives of small companies that make pagination equipment. The end-users were there to learn about available systems. The vendors were there to disseminate information about their products and find out what the competition is doing. Most of the presentations were by vendors, although a couple were by users describing their experiences with particular equipment.I learned a lot about the publishing industry and what kinds of needs these people have. By and large, they are a very conservative group. Their two overriding concerns are quality and cost effectiveness. Any equipment they buy must meet their needs exactly; they are not willing to sacrifice the quality of their own product just to make their job easier.There seem to be three broad markets for pagination equipment:1) newspapers   This area is very specialized and is heavily layout oriented. Typical systems show the layout of a page on the screen, allowing the user to define rectangular areas and assign text blocks, ads, or photographs to them. Each page is laid out by hand; the system handles the formatting of text into the defined areas, including continuation across pages. Few fonts are required and (obviously) "newspaper quality" is good enough.   2) graphic arts, ad make-up   Here everything is done on a single page basis and the emphasis is on high quality output with elaborate page layouts, heavy use of graphics, and extremely diverse font requirements. This area is currently the least automated of the three.   3) books, manuals, reports, etc. (includes "tech. pubs.")   The third major area includes multiple-page documents containing primarily text with embedded pictures. Layout requirements are likely to be expressible as a set of standards that can be applied to an entire document. Two subareas are defined by the quality required of the final result. Commercial publishers generally require higher quality than in-plant operations.   Automatic pagination systems currently on the market fall into 4 categories:1) algorithmic/batch pagination   These are the "document compilers". Formatting commands are embedded into the text as it is entered. The result cannot be seen until it comes out of the typesetter or proof printer. Systems of this kind are applicable to books, manuals, and a lot of in-plant publishing.   2) layout driven   Newspaper systems (described above)3) interactive   The opposite of batch pagination.  Each page is laid out manually (on a CRT) in the form it will appear when printed.   4) interventional   This is a batch pagination system with a screen for previewing the result. It is possible to see the output before committing it to hard copy. but it is still necessary to rerun the job to make changes.   Currently, no system does a complete job of integrating text, line art, and continuous tone images and getting to a phototypesetter in one step. Most commonly, only the text appears in the output with holes reserved for illustrations. The illustrations themselves are inserted manually. There were two systems I saw, however, that I thought were especially interesting. One provides Doodle-like editing facilities for scanned line art and continuous tone images; the other embodies many of the advanced document formatting and layout facilities we have in mind for Star.Imagitex image processing system.Hardware:  Desktop digitizer    input format: 8 1/2 x 11" or 5 x 11"    resolution: 475 dpi or 775 dpi    grey levels: 256    speed: 1 to 1 1/2 min per page  Disk storage    2 158 megabyte drives    A single image requires between 2 megabytes (line art)      and 20 megabytes (continuous tone).  Workstation    dual 68000 processors    11 x 11" tablet    19" color display      640 x 512 x 10 bits    Price: $115,000The system supports cropping, sizing, rotation, moving/copying, and airbrushing, as well as operations on the grey level mapping, including contrast/brightness control, posterization (contouring), thresholding, and spot color. (A separate bit map is produced for each color.) There are three different display resolutions, so that it is possible to see up to 16 images on the screen at a time or to work at the bit level in a portion of a single image. All editing operations are available at any resolution.Disadvantages are that there is no support for text, and there is currently no hardcopy output device.Xyvision composition and pagination systemHardware (full-blown version):  system control unit    68000 processor    768K byte RAM    1-4 70 megabyte Winchester disks  2 graphics workstations    68000 processor with 768K byte RAM    16-bit display list processor with 1 megabyte RAM    11.5 x 11.5" B&W bitmap display (89 dpi vertically, 178 dpi horizontally)  4 text-only editing terminals  dot matrix printer  Canon laser printer  Price: $150,000  Supports both batch and interactive pagination. Handles headings, footnotes, sidenotes, hyphenation, widow/orphan control, floating illustrations, cross references, and table of contents generation. Also it has a spelling checker and at least a simple version of styles. There are two modes of display, one showing embedded formatting commands, and a "presentation mode" that shows the page as it will appear when printed. It can display a single page, 2 or 4 pages simultaneously, or one page plus the 2 pages on either side at reduced scale. Documents can be recomposed (paginated) all at once (claim: 3 seconds/page) or in smaller segments (e.g. paragraph, section). In presentation mode, formatting changes can be made to a page directly, but these changes are lost if the page is recomposed. Disadvantages: not yet being shipped, no graphics facilities (graphics at least a year away).Xerox was mentioned a lot at the conference, primarily in the context of laser printers and Ethernet.Many of the vendors talked about networking, but no one seems to be doing it yet.Laser printers are considered useful for final output in in-plant printing and as "proof printers" otherwise.Star and Lisa were usually mentioned in the same breath, and, currently, they are not taken seriously for this market. I heard two somewhat contradictory remarks: that "the Xerox strategy of expecting office workers to do formatting and layout is probably wrong", and that "combining the document creation and formatting functions may be the way a good deal of publishing is done in the future".From what I saw of these people's needs, I don't think what we have now will sell to anyone in this market. Our document formatting facilities are just too incomplete, and it is impractical to generate all illustrations with structured graphics. However, I think we could have a strong entry in the in-plant publishing market by just getting scanned images and complete document formatting facilities into Star. Adding a good phototypesetter would broaden our market even further.-- Bill*start*00534 00024 US Date: 10 May 1983 4:24 pm PDT (Tuesday)From: GWilliams.PASubject: Re: Press/InterpressIn-reply-to: Evans.EOS's message of 5 May 1983 2:23 pm PDT (Thursday)To: Evans.EOScc: GWilliams, Hains.EOSBill,When you speak of turning off page sync, do you mean the 6800?

The code is on your directory so I had assumed that youwrote it (of course too much time may have passed).  Let me know if this is notthe case.Page sync is set in the slot interface by the 6801 when that status character isreceived from the Raven.  To turn it off at a later time you had two sections ofcode for the 6800. First, when the status character "pagedelivered" arrived you removed the pagesync signal out of the board to the Alto.  This code is commented out and notused.  I would like to know why--if you remember.Second is the way it is done now in the proms.  When page sync is set, a countis set for the number of times the 6801's timer will compare.  This just lengthensthe timer total time.  When the total time expires the pagesync signal to the Altois reset.My main question in all of this why did you move from the status in clearingthe pagesync signal.  The thermal printer and spitfires run at different ratesthan the raven but I want the same prom to run all three and must try to usethe status but if you had problems then????ThanksBill*start*01354 00024 US Date: 11 May 1983 2:47 pm PDT (Wednesday)From: GWilliams.PASubject: Re: Press/InterpressIn-reply-to: Evans.EOS's message of 11 May 1983 9:01 am PDT (Wednesday)To: Evans.EOScc: GWilliams, Hains.EOS, PaxtonBill,Yes I did write the code and yes it was a long time ago.  I'd forgotten thecomplications that had to be worked around.In a nut shell, I had to use a time out in order to make the Raven work correctlywith Press.  It turns out that "pagedelivered" comes from the Raven too late tocontinue printing if it is a multi page document, as the Raven would shut down.There is another signal, I believe it is readyToFeed or some such, that the Ravenhands back during the printing of the first page that means it can take anotherfeed command.  You can't use that for timing info as you're in the middle offlinging bits.You might ask why one can't remember we got a readyToFeed and send thatdown to the Raven during the current print, but you might be on a one-pagerun or the end of a multi-page run.  The main problem there being one ofneeding more communication from Press.  I chose not to restructure the workingsof Press if I could avoid it.If you're designing an ESS, you might want to work in a scheme that allows youto "prenotify" the Raven (or thermal printer or spitfire) as mentioned here.Glen*start*00470 00024 US Date: 12 May 1983 8:47 am PDT (Thursday)From: Evans.EOSSubject: Re: Press/InterpressIn-reply-to: GWilliams.PA's message of 11 May 1983 2:47 pm PDT (Wednesday)To: GWilliams.PAcc: EvansThanks for the info--hated to take you back that far.

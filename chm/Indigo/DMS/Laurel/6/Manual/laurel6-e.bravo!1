Laurel 6 vs. Laurel 5.1z18415l3175y756x3qck40\g36f1GAppendix E. Laurel 6 vs. Laurel 5.1 and LaurelXz18415l3175x3e30jk80(2116)\f5bThe facilities available in Laurel 5.1 and LaurelX have been merged in Laurel 6.  Where features of those two systems were in conflict, there is usually a profile option in Laurel 6 that chooses between them.  Laurel 6 also has a significant number of changes and improvements over Laurel 5.1 and LaurelX.  This appendix lists the most important of these changes.z18415l3175x3e20jk40(635)Profile optionsz18415l3175x3e20jk40(2116)\i15bISeveral Laurel profile options are no longer supported in their former ways.  The profile options Authenticate:, Herald:, HeraldFont:, Logo:, LogoFont:, Poll:, and DisplayErrorPups: are no longer recognized by Laurel.  The Authenticate: option has been subsumed by the Registry: entry in your profile.  The other entries that deal with hardcopy options are subsumed by the more general hardcopy forms (Appendix C).z18415l3175x3e12jk40(635)The Laurel profile error reporting mechanism catches these entries and gives you the explanation:z18415l3175x3e12jk40The profile field x is no longer supported.z18415l4445x3e6jk40\18i2Iwhere x is one of the above mentioned profile fields.z18415l3175x3e6jk40\6i1IMessage transport systemz18415l3175x3e20jk40(2116)\i24bIGrapevine is replacing the older MTP message transport implementation.  If your registry is served by Grapevine, your password must be understood by that system.  If you are in such a registry, and your name and password are not acceptable to Laurel, then you should contact an administrator for your registry to correct the password held for you by Grapevine.z18415l3175x3e12jk40(635)The administration of public distribution lists in Grapevine registries is much more flexible than in registries servd by MTP (IFS's).  Consult Appendix B, Maintain, for further details.  Due to the change in the way distribution lists are stored, the results of a Get on a public distribution list may be slightly different than in the past.z18415l3175x3e12jk40\265b3BThe Laurel user interfacez18415l3175x3e20jk40(2116)\i25bIThe arrangement of screen commands has been altered slightly from previous versions of Laurel.  The Delete command has been moved next to the Display command, with the Hardcopy command now placed at the right margin.  The {brackets} for several commands, e.g., for Get and Put, are now located on a second menu line that only becomes visible when you need it.  Just invoke these commands in the normal way; their {brackets} will appear automatically.z18415l3175x3e12jk40(635)\100b6B36b7B19b8B46b1B8b1B33b3B5b3B137b1B8b1BThe Hardcopy command now displays a property sheet with several settable parameters available.  Try it, you'll like it.z18415l3175x3e12jk40\4b8BYou can make discontiguous selections in the table-of-contents region.  See section 2.3.1 for details.z18415l3175x3e12jk40Facilities for filling in {brackets} have been expanded considerably.  See section 2.1.3. for details.z18415l3175x3e12jk40\26b1B8b1BContinuous scrolling now occurs when you hold a mouse button down continuously in the scroll bar.  Various parameters that change the timing behavior of continuous scrolling are settable in your Laurel profile.z18415l3175x3e12jk40A new kind of selection, shifted selection, is an alternative to type-in whether you use the old-style modal editor or the newer modeless editor.  See section 4.3.2 for details.z18415l3175x3e12jk40New screen commands, Copy and Run, are available.  Copy provides FTP-like services; Run allows you to run various programs while still in Laurel.  These commands are described along with all the Laurel screen commands in section 3.z18415l3175x3e12jk40\21b4B5b3B18b4B29b3BThe Laurel editorz18415l3175x3e20jk40(2116)\i17bIThe Laurel editor now comes in two flavors, modal and modeless.  The modal editor is similar to the editor in Laurel 5.1; the modeless editor is similar to the one in LaurelX.  A large number of new editor commands are available in either editor.  See section 4 for details.z18415l3175x3e12jk40(635)If you used Laurel 5.1 previouslyz18415l3175x3e20jk40(2116)\i33bIThe default settings for profile options are set to emulate the behavior of Laurel 5.1.  Thus, Laurel 6 is upward compatible with Laurel 5.1.  However, a substantial amount of functionality has been added to Laurel 6 that was prevously available in LaurelX only.  You may wish to change some of your option settings or take advantage of additional facilities, so read on.z18415l3175x3e12jk40(635)If you used LaurelX previouslyz18415l3175x3e20jk40(2116)\i30bIThe editor in LaurelX has become the Laurel 6 modeless editor.  You will want to set the Editor: modeless option in your Laurel profile to enable the modeless editor.  The Laurel 6 modeless editor does expand the functionality of the LaurelX editor considerably.  See section 4 for details.z18415l3175x3e12jk40(635)Laurel 6 will print on a HyType printer.  You will need to put appropriate hardcopy forms in your Laurel profile to use the HyType properly.z18415l3175x3e12jk40To get the LaurelX style prompts in the feedback region, use the ErrorKeys: LaurelX option in the Laurel profile.z18415l3175x3e12jk40The Editor command of LaurelX, with its fast swapping to BravoX is gone.  The only way to return to BravoX (or any other stand-alone program for that matter) is to quit from Laurel 6 and enter the other program normally through the Alto Executive.z18415l3175x3e12jk40\4b6BSupport for LaurelX is terminated.  Laurel 6 is its supported replacement.z18415l3175x3e12jk40

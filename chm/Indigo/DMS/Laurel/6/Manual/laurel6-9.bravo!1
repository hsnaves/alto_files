Things a casual user doesn't really need to knowz18415l3175x3e30jk792(2116)\f5b51BFor each mail file x, Laurel creates a separate file x-dmsTOC, which holds various internal information about the table-of-contents.  When you invoke Mail file {x}, Laurel will recreate this file if necessary.  Naturally, this slows down the Mail file command.z18415l3175x3e20jk40(635)\19i1I33i1I4f1 3f0 89b9B2i1I80b9BLaurel creates scratch files while it is working and leaves them on your Alto disk.  You may delete these files (named DMS-n.TMP for various values of n) if necessary, though Laurel ensures that they will not grow very large.  If you terminate a Laurel session abnormally (or Laurel crashes) then these files might actually be quite large.  Deleting them lengthens the time required to start up Laurel. z18415l3175x3e12jk40\119f1 3f0 1i1I1f1 3f0 23i1I75f1 112f0If Laurel generates an automatic error report directed to LaurelSupport.PA (see section 4), it will leave behind a file Laurel.BugReport$ containing the text of that report.  You may delete this file if you wish.z18415l3175x3e12jk40SHIFT-SWAT is disabled in Laurel soon after start-up, since SWAT is one of the COM keys.  You may achieve a SHIFT-SWAT by holding down the combination SHIFT-NEXT-COM.  Performing such an action is of dubious value.z18415l3175x3e12jk40\f1 10f0 50f1 4f0 15f1 3f0 26f1 10f0 33f1 14f0 z18415l3175x3e12jk40

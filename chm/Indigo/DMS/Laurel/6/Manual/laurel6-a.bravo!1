If you typez18415l3175x3e6jk40(635)\26b9B>Laurel filename CRz18415l4445x3e6k40(0,6304)\8i8I1f1 2f0Laurel will read filename.mail instead.  If you supply an explicit extension, Laurel will respect it, otherwise it will add the .mail suffix.z18415l3175x3e6jk40(635)\17i8IIn-box interrogationz18415l3175x3e20jk40(2116)\i20bIYou can also request that Laurel access your in-box automatically when it begins execution.  Typez18415l3175x3e12jk40(635)>Laurel/n CR     or>Laurel/n filename CRz18415l4445x3e6k40(0,7648)(1,9152)\10f1 7f0 2f1 1f0 10i8I1f1 2f0Laurel will first perform an implicit Mail file on the indicated or defaulted file (see above).  It then will check to see if messages are present in your in-box.  If so, Laurel performs an implicit New mail  command.  Upon the completion of the New mail command (if performed), Laurel is available for normal use.z18415l3175x3e6jk40(635)\38b9B152b9B38b8BYou may also invoke Laurel byz18415l3175x3e12jk40>Laurel/c CR     or>Laurel/c filename CRz18415l4445x3e6k40(0,7648)\10f1 7f0 2f1 1f0 10i8I1f1 2f0If messages are present in your in-box, Laurel will behave as though "/n" were specified.  If no new mail exists, Laurel will omit the implicit Mail file and return directly to the Alto Executive.  A fine point:  if Laurel is unable to contact your in-box(es), it returns to the Alto Executive.  Laurel will not return to the Alto Executive, however, if there is no password on your disk.  In this case it will allow you to log in with the User command and continue to run Laurel.z18415l3175x3e6jk40(635)\144b9B45f1 242b4BSend message modez18415l3175x3e20jk40(2116)\i17bIIf you merely want to send a message, you may request that Laurel omit its implicit Mail file when it begins execution.  Typez18415l3175x3e12jk40(635)\84b9B>Laurel/s CRz18415l4445x3e6k40(0,6304)(1,7456)\10f1 2f0Instead of reading a mail file, Laurel will perform an implicit New form as it starts up.  You may then compose and deliver your message in the usual way.  If, after doing so, you wish to process a mail file, simply invoke Mail file and supply a file name as described in section 3.1.3.z18415l3175x3e6jk40(635)\64b8B151b9B z18415l3175x3e6jk40

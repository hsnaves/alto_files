The Houses are laid out in the segment with the first House--   occupying the first words of the segment, immediately followed by its text.  This is--   immediately followed by the next House and its text, etc.  The nextHouse field of each--   House other than the last House contains a 1.  The nextHouse field of the last House--   contains a 0.-- Procedures --SwapInMenu: PROCEDURE [menuSegment: lsD.StateSegment] RETURNS [hp: HousePtr];-- Swaps in the menu contained in menuSegment and locks it in memory.  Sets all nextHouse--   pointers in the house list swapped in to be true pointers to the next House in the list.--   Returns a pointer to the head of the list.ReleaseMenu: PROCEDURE [menuSegment: lsD.StateSegment];-- Resets all pointers in the menuSegment to their canonical swapped out form: all nextHouse--   fields are set to 1 except for the last which is set to 0.  Releases the menuSegment.MapHouseNumberToHousePtr: PROCEDURE [knownHp: HousePtr, knownHpNumber,	number: HouseNumber] RETURNS [hp: HousePtr];-- Returns a pointer to the number'th house (first cnp.houses is number 0) in the house list--   pointed to by knownHp.  KnownHp's HouseNumber is knownHpNumber.  This procedure--   should be used to set HousePtr's for houses that are relocated in segments.ChangeEditorMenu: PROCEDURE [newState: EditorMenuState];-- Change the Editor menu to reflect the newState.  Raises the resumable SIGNAL--   MenuChange if the menu is actually changing.MenuChange: SIGNAL;-- Raised by ChangeCommandMenu to notify any HousePtr holders that they may be--   invalid.END.  -- of LaurelMenuDefs --z20461l3008(529)\f1

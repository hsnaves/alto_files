E.g., I often wonder just what I DO have selected in the invisible partsof the TOC.  Herewith some suggestions:Beneath the TOC thumb line, place a (rotated and miniaturized) selectiontriangle for EACH selected entry.  Consecutive selection might be indicated byan extended "selection trapezoid.  Use the vertical bar to indicate the currentlydisplayed message.Beneath the displayed message thumb line, use a dashed underline to indicatethe range of any active secondary selection in the displayed message.Ditto for the Composed message, but also use a solid underline for the primaryselection (video reverse of the thumb line for Pending Delete!).  Use a caret toindicate the typein point.  Get rid of the vertical bar, except as the cursor forthumbing.Jim H.*start*00685 00024 US Date: 24 Sept. 1980 11:51 am PDT (Wednesday)From: HorningSubject: Another Multimenu?To: Brotzcc: LaurelImp^I keep hearing complaints of the form "DO/ESC, CANCEL, and MOVE almostalways do good things, but it's hard to predict what they will be, because thebuffers aren't visible."How about a command that would bring up a multimenu line with brackets forthe deleted and inserted strings?

Once you have it, you will neverwant to go back to Bravo scrolling or jumpy scrolling--it is a real winner.Bob Ayers, Charles Irby, and others have worked out the smooth scrollingproblem fairly carefully for Star, and Ayers has written a memo.  There, it isquite complicated because they only want to scroll a small window which is notthe full width of the screen (there is special hardware in the Dandelion to helpthis, but we will not be able to implement the microcode, Pilot support, and Starsupport to take advantage of it in the first release of Star).I should think that smooth scrolling will be much simpler for Laurel becauseyour window is full width and you have the features of the Alto displaycontroller.  I believe that the strategy is something along the following lines:	Maintain a bitmap somewhat larger than the window being scrolled (25%	is the number that comes to mind).  This bitmap can be in two parts, one	part being the bitmap for the window itself, and the other part being an	"extension" which is allocated at the time the scrolling starts.  Treat this	combined bitmap as a circular buffer for lines being displayed.	Have two processes, a producer and a consumer.  The producer paints new	lines into the undisplayed portion of the bitmap.  The consumer wakes up	on every vertical retrace, checks a counter or clock, and (if it is time)	trims one line off the top of the displayed portion and adds one line to the	bottom.  This trimming is done by adjusting the pointers and counts in	the DCB's for the two parts of the bitmap.  The line at the top is returned	to the producer; if the line at the bottom is not ready, scrolling takes a	hiccup and waits.	When the user stops scrolling, you need to consolidate all of the displayed	lines into your primary bitmap and throw away the extension.If you are able to do this or something equivalent within the limitations ofLaurel, I think you will have a lot of friends./Hugh*start*00665 00024 US Date: 9 Jan. 1981 3:14 pm PST (Friday)From: Schroeder.PASubject: AltoDir's idea of legal filenamesTo: Brotz---------------------------Date: 9 Jan. 1981 2:18 pm PST (Friday)From: Newman.ESSubject: AltoDir's idea of legal filenames...To: LaurelSupport.paReply-To: Newmancc: Newman...doesn't quite match that of the Alto Operating system.

If I'mreviewing mail files, looking for a specific message, etc., I want to proceedthrough all of them.  Similar argument for putting things away (move to).-- ideally, would like cycling to be shorthand for scrolling through a windowcontaining the list of file names.  If that window could be made visible, onecould use selection to grab a particular file.  Ignore this comment.	Note about confirmation:It's seemed to me for some time that you missed a semantic simplification when itcomes to confirmation.  It goes as follows:For many of your commands, Red proposes a command, awaiting (optional)parameter change and confirmation (via Yellow or ESC) before carrying out thecommand.  Blue both proposes and confirms the command, using the previousparameter values, if any -- it's equivalent to Red, followed by Yellow or ESC.Semantically simplified version:Red "opens" any parameter brackets associated with the command, arms ESC tomean "Blue me" (see below), and perhaps provokes a prompt request forconfirmation in the status area.Blue performs the command over which it is invoked, using the current value ofany parameter -- same as now, but whether or not Red has recently beeninvoked.  ESC has been armed to mean the same thing as "Blue applied to mostrecent Red command".  Thus Blue picks up the notion of confirmation of Redalong with its current atomic behavior.Any other mouse activity, or DEL, simply cancels the prompt, disables editing inthe brackets, and does what the mouse would do in that instance.  Now it's lessmodeful.Yellow could continue to mean Blue for a while, only after Red though, just toallow people to change their ways.No suggestion about the secondary confirmation requests when zapping old filesor tossing out undelivered messages -- current scheme's as good as any?You may recognize this as a meander back towards the command/bracketsemantics of BravoX, which I like.  The new thing would be Red as an easierway to edit the whole bracket field than BravoX provides.  If you also allowedselection and editing within brackets, you'd just about have a superset of theBravoX semantics again, except that the referent of ESC would sometimes beambiguous.Side point:  what prompted me to think about this again was some combination ofplaying with the new scrolling stuff, and my discovery that for somebracket-parameter commands (e.g., Get, Put), ESC is the ONLY valid confirmationcharacter, whereas for others, either ESC or Yellow will do.  That reminded me ofthe more general simplification, which would among other things cure theproblem with Get, and ...*start*00623 00024 US Date: 8 Feb. 1981 3:11 pm PST (Sunday)From: Schroeder.PASubject: "Files" nits / wishesTo: Brotz---------------------------Date: 6 Feb. 1981 6:06 pm PST (Friday)From: Hamilton.ESSubject: "Files" nits / wishesTo: LaurelSupport.PAcc: Hamilton(1) It seems a little strange that, to ctrl-del out of deleting a series of files, youhave to type a <CR> in addition to the ctrl-del, when it's sitting there asking forconfirmation.(2) It sure would be nice to have a "confirm all deletes automatically" feature ala IFS.--Bruce------------------------------------------------------------*start*00569 00024 US Date: 10 Feb. 1981 3:26 pm PST (Tuesday)From: schmidt.PASubject: MType under Laurel 6To: Lyon, BaskettReply-To: schmidtcc: BrotzI've just gotten MType to run under Laurel 6T30.

It occurs to me that this goes abit further than just the 90-degree rotation of the cursor and the use ofRed/Yellow to select units/composites.In particular, the "story" for point-and-type should be that to put the caretbetween lines/paragraphs one simply points where one wants it to go, withoutworrying about whether the underline goes before or after it.  This implies twochanges to the present scheme:	-the caret CANNOT be tied to the line that is underlined, and must be	able to follow a selected carriage return; and	-"Balance beam" selection must work for Red in the line bar (i.e., the	caret should move down a line several scan lines before the underline	does). I would still like a set of caret movement operations that would avoidthe necessity of going to the mouse for small jumps.  I have seen theerror of my ways, and am willing to treat these as editing operations, rather thancommands.  I propose using Space with modifiers for this purpose.-Control+Space will advance the caret over the next character (logicallyequivalent to Shift+BS followed by re-typing the character).-Com+Space will advance the caret over the next word.-Shift added to either of the above will reverse the direction.[I have no very strong opinion on which should be the default direction.]Date: 29 Oct. 1980 6:20 pm PST (Wednesday)From: HorningSubject: The Disk, The Clock, and DELAs I was watching my disk pages tick down one by one, and the displayed timeon the "clock" get farther and farther behind, I had leisure for the followingseries of thoughts:1) Why is it any easier to update the free disk page count than the clock?[Actually, I presume that it isn't, it's just another routine's responsibility.]2) Why couldn't the page count update routine also call the clock updateroutine?[After all, the cost of the update must be small compared to allocating or freeinga disk page.]3) Why couldn't this same routine also check for DEL-for-cancel?[Most of the things I would like to cancel use up disk space--slowly butinexorably.

If the contents of the brackets is a prefix of asingle file, then extend the contents to the full name, otherwise don't (much likethe existing Alto Executive convention).This would make long, meaningful names less burdensome, and help to alleviatethe problem of remembering what abbreviation has been chosen for a file name.Jim H.*start*01470 00024 US Date: 26 Feb. 1981 1:30 pm PST (Thursday)From: Levin.PASubject: Flexible mail stampsTo: Karltoncc: Schroeder, Brotz, LevinIt appears that variable-sized stamps work in Laurel 6T31.  To permit gracefulfuture expansion, we would like to have some conventions for the format of thevariable part.  In particular, it should be a sequence of self-identifying entities,thereby allowing multiple independent programs to manipulate it.  I propose thefollowing format:Following the fixed part of the stamp (i.e., the initial 24 characters ending in aCR), there is an optional variable part, which is present iff the second decimalnumber in the fixed part exceeds 24.  The syntax of the variable part is asfollows:variable-part ::= @ item-list @item-list ::= <empty> | item-list itemitem ::= byte-length space type space contentsbyte-length ::= <5-character decimal number as in the fixed part>type ::= <5-character decimal number as in the fixed part>contents ::= <sequence of byte-length minus 4 characters>space ::= <040C>Semantics:Types are assigned by a central authority (LaurelSupport).  The byte-length isthe total length of the item in bytes, including the 12 characters occupied by thebyte-count, type, and associate spaces.  Thus, a count of < 12 is illegal.  Theserules imply that the second count in the fixed part of the header can onlylegally assume the values 24, 26 (variable part is "@@"), and >= 38.Roy*start*00376 00024 US Date: 3 March 1981 11:47 am PST (Tuesday)From: Levin.PASubject: Small correction to Flexible mail stamps semanticsTo: Karlton, BrotzReply-To: Levincc: Schroeder, Levincontents ::= <sequence of byte-length minus 4 characters>is in the original.

Here's asummary.++++++++++++++++++++KUDOS1) I love the modeless editor.  This goes without saying, since we designed muchthe same interface into Star.  (However you really should get rid of the "balancebeam" method of placing the caret.  Always append.  Or at least make it anoption.  Very error prone. -- Dave Smith2) I love the ability to EASILY copy existing text.  Just push the Shift key downand select the text to copy.  Wonderful!  Much, much better than Bravo's orStar's.  In fact, I'm going to try to get it into Star.  For the first time ever on theAlto, it really is easier to copy from existing text than to type it. -- Dave Smith3) I love type-over replacement.  A real time-saver.  This will probably not gointo Star (sigh) because it is just not compatible with Star's concepts.  But it sureworks well for you folks. -- Dave Smith4) Overall, I really like the system - good work! -- Mike Trigoboff5) I never encounter any bugs in the software you guys release so, indesperation, I pass along this trivial observation.  (Appears below)  The care youtake in making your releases really frustrates us nit pickers.a -- Chuck Geschke6) I've been meaning to tell you:  SearchMail is the greatest thing since slicedbread!  Thanks! -- Bruce Hamilton SUGGESTIONS/BUGS1) I have written an itty-bitty program to change between white-on-black andblack-on-white  The program is available as [rain]<Hamilton>laurel>Flip.(mesalaurel). -- Bruce Hamilton 2) a brief set of rules for preparing programs for the RUN button. -- BillMcKeeman3) an understandable model of the button behavior.  Example: using the middlebutton to attempt to expand the bottom window when the system has warned thatsomething is about to wipe it out.  And I think there are situations where eachof buttons 1, 2 and 3 mean DO IT. -- Bill McKeeman 4) an "AutomaticUpdate" entry in the profile might be a good default for themasses.  It seems to me that it is those least able to recover from the self-imposedtrouble of an out-of-date program that are most likely to procrastinate doing whatis necessary to keep an up-to-date version on their disk.  It would also keep agood version on the public machines for which nobody in particular takesresponsibility. -- Bill McKeeman5) a profile entry like "InitialBoundary" similar to "Boundary" which wouldbring up Laurel with the specified window boundaries -- Bob Weissman6) a Sort command (or subprogram) to sort a message file chronologically -- BobWeissman7) I have the following lines in my user.cm:	[LAUREL]	Boundary: 0, 12, 19, 16	Boundary: 1, 1, 0, 0	Boundary: 2, 0, 1, 0	Boundary: 3, 0, 0, 1	Boundary: 8, 12, 35, 0	Boundary: 9, 12, 0, 35When I invoke COM+8 or COM+9, sometimes it leaves the upper window thesame size and sometimes it makes it a little smaller.  The latter seems to happenmost often when manual size adjustments via the control point are interspersed. Sometimes COM+0 does this too.  Am I missing something? -- Dave Smith8) When I type BACKSPACE with the shift key held down, it deletes forward! This is very annoying because one of the most frequent times I make typos iswhen I am typing an all uppercase word, like "BACKSPACE", which I do withmy little finger held on the Shift key.  Nice try, but that one just doesn't work. Please at least make it an option. -- Dave Smith9) I find it a minor irritation with Laurel that my copies of my own messages getflagged with a question mark when retrieved back from the Grapevine.  Thequestion mark flag should indicate those messages that I haven't yet read, NOTjust copies of my own messages coming back for record-keeping purposes.  Infact, it would also be nice if copies of my own messages did not count as "newmail" in my mailbox;  but that is less of an aggravation.    Would it be easy toleave off the question mark on copies, at least as an option? -- Lyle Ramshaw10) It would be nice if there could be such a thing as delayed delivery mail. That is, one could add message header fields, Delivery-Date and Delivery-Time,which would permit one to schedule delivery up to, say, a year in the future. Such mail could also, perhaps, be cancelled no later than five minutes inadvance of the scheduled delivery time.  The effect of the Delivery Date andTime is to cause the same effect as if the user had invoked Deliver at the statedDate and Time.  What would this be useful for?  There are a number ofexamples.  One could send out a batch of regularly scheduled announcements,such as Forum announcements, at the beginning of each month, with deliverydelayed until the beginning of the week in question, and a reminder scheduledfor noon on the same day.  People could schedule reminders for themselves. --Martin Haeberli11) editing in brackets -- Mike Trigoboff12) In SearchMail, could you provide something that just searched the headerfield(s) chosen?  Like if I wanted to select all my msgs from LaurelSupport, or allthe msgs I sent, or all with a particular subject.  The search would run a lotfaster if it didn't have to needlessly search the body of each msg.  (The way itworks now is valuable too - this is a request for an additional capability.) --Mike Trigoboff13) while "Move to" does a "Delete" as a subcommand, it does not do a "Displayafter Delete" when that is enabled.  It seems natural and desireable for it to do so.-- Forest Baskett14) PROBLEM WITH "Reply-To":  The sender and answerer both are required totry think about the insoluble question of who will be interested in the responsesto the original message.  Then, they HAVE TO DO EDITING IN THE MOSTCOMMON CASE, which is that everyone the message is sent to will be interestedin the answers, in which case either the sender or the answerer has to delete the"Reply-To" line.  THIS IS BAD DESIGN.  The whole point of the ANSWERcommand is that you should NOT have to do editing on the address in the mostcommon case!ALTERNATIVE APPROACH  (Mild version):  Require confirmation whenREPLYING to a distribution list! (Don't we already do this? MDS)  This isdownright obvious.  The lack of this could actually be considered a logical bugin the current Laurel.  It might even be worth requiring DOUBLE confirmation,as does copydisk:  "Are you REALLY sure?"ALTERNATIVE APPROACH  (Strong version):  The ANSWER command simplydoes not copy distribution list expressions.  If the answerer wants to reply to a dl, he has to edit the dl expression back into the address.  I would favor thisapproach. -- Joe Becker15) In many situations, Laurel treats the middle mouse button as <esc> but notfor files or subsystem name completion in the bottom window.

Didpeople really find it difficult to delete the Reply-To line?  I suppose.Assuming you intend to keep this approach, it brings up another issue -- theconfirmation thing, which inherently increases the temporal modefulness of thesystem -- either you confirm or deny, but no other actions are available to youat the time you're doing it.   The "blue button" approach overrides someconfirmation requests before they happen, but others remain.  (We've discussedthis sort of thing before)  Here's an alternative approach that remains modeless: When a situation requiring confirmation arises, blink and moan as now, andignore the request.  Then replace the original menu item with one or severalmore powerful ones, possibly including one to forget the whole thing.  Thiscorresponds approximately to the current handling of Hardcopy.  Put the mostlikely response at the position of the original, if it's not too dangerous, or put theone that cancels under the original, if it is.  Now temporal modes have againbeen translated into spatial ones, which (shall we pray) is wonderful.A simpler thing to do is to more widely publicize the cycling capability of theGet command through .form files, so I can make one with Reply-To in it in thefirst place.Here's something else, more or less related, that I've wanted to be easier -- it'svery specialized, but it happens all the time (you asked for it by diddlingfeatures at this late date):  I'd like to have a keyboard command to delete(probably by expanding the pending-delete selection?) the entire line containingthe current pending-delete selection.  This is where I don't want to cc themessage to anybody at all.  With this feature you could leave Reply-To in andmake it very easy to delete it.  There's probably a generalization of this feature,with respect to other kinds of selections, that makes sense.  I know:  ctrl-NEXT. I can do it with the mouse but it takes a motion to the mouse,  motion of themouse to the line, and two clicks (three unless I'm clever) to get rid of the line.User programming!

We furtherpresent an algorithm for local optimization of the intermediate code.  Wemeasured a saving of about 16% improvement (in instruction count) overunoptimized code, at a cost of xx% increase in compile time.  This comparesfavorably with several other more elaborate published schemes.General Commentary.It is readable.  The English is adequate.  It is wordy, using turgid prose wheretables would suffice (It also needs an adverb predator).   It contains too muchtutorial material.  Why repeat essentially the same examples and reasoning thathas graced this subliterature from the beginning of time?While the authors could present the important material, essentially theappendices, in a few pages, I do not believe they wish to do so.  Theunfortunate consequence is that a class or readers, those that are not going topress on to the end, will never see the best part of the work.  I would put thosetables right there in the way so they have to be explicitly skipped over to beavoided.General Summary.  Publish it.Now for a little bitching and moaning.(pg 2) The dividing line between compiler and back-end is not clearly drawn.Moreover the n-language, m-machine strategy gets somewhat more complicatedas n and m increase.  The reader would be interested in what class of languages,and what class of machines fit into the n or m.  Lisp? Snobol? Prolog? -- A Lispmachine?  A Turing machine?  Or perhaps it works only for dialects of Pascaland single address machines.  On page 14 the claim of "many machines" needsmore precision.  (pg 2)  The underlined emphasis is unstylish and also incorrect.  The most thatcan be said is that there are good reasons to do optimizations on the intermediatecode.  Because, by working VERY hard, one could push more than is reasonableinto the intermediate code optimizer.  What can be said is that, if N is theanticipated number of back-ends, it is worth putting things into the intermediatecode optimizer that are not (roughly speaking) N-times harder to do there.(pg 3-9)  Only about 1/2 of this stuff is worth reading.  A diagram would bebetter than all of section 2.   Most of us that care about the topic can figure outwhat code sequences make sense for what languages.  The tricks aboutconditionals do need to be emphaized, however.(pg 4-7)  To repeat myself, his seems summarizable by saying that "it is moreefficient to put patterns in a table rather than in code".  By and large this is arehash of the concept of local optimization.  The paper will be stronger with amuch shorter section here.  I definitely get the impression it is written forsomeone who understands nothing about optimization.  That is the wrongaudience.(pg 7-9)  The implicit assumption is that it is time for which the optimization isbeing done, and that perhaps space will come along with it.  That is not alwaysthe case and deserves mention.  And, later, space is used as the measure ofsuccess.(pg 9)  "backs up" is a slightly unfortunate choice of words because might read"backtracking" into it.  It is the pointer that is backed up so far as I can tell.(pg 9-16)  Unredeeminly boring.  The authors might question whether thismaterial is worth including.  What is the point?  You are recapping thereasoning that led to the results.  It is like finding the musings of amathematician in the middle of a proof.  A better approach is to key on the mostsignificant frequencies, and say where they came from.(pg 16-17)  The first test is claimed to be "independent of both source languageand target machine".  Just so!  It is therefore an irrelevant measure.  Unless thereis evidence that it makes for a better result, there is no point in publishing thefigures.  A more homely example of this kind of reasoning is: "We knocked down17% of all the straw men we set up."  There is no way to know if the ADI 0improvement, for example, is an artifact of a dumb compiler that should neverhave emitted it, or a substantive problem now resolved.  The subsequentcomments for PDP-11 code are better.  It would be better to merely present thelatter, and then point out that they do not differ much from figures derived fromEM-1 alone.(pg 18)  The argument about INC makes no sense at all.  The substance of it isthat in a nice clean intermediate machine, we can depend on doing these thingswithout wierd side effects.  But then the code emitter will just have to undo thework because its real INC instruction is in fact wierd, and does not have exactlythe same semantics as the intermediate INC.  A more serious consequence of thisnature is that constant folding might cause an interrupt at compile time thatshould occur at run time.  How is this handled?------------------------------------------------------------*start*00986 00024 US Date: 16 April 1981 2:35 pm PST (Thursday)From: Horning.paSubject: Confirmation ConsistencyTo: Brotzcc: LaurelImp^Doug,Right button (Blue) selection in 6T39 does indeed confirm the first set of bracketsfor Copy.  However, for the other command with two sets of brackets(Substitute), it confirms both.For neither command is there a single action to confirm both sets of bracketsafter a left button (Red) or Com+s activation.I think you should strive for consistency here.  I have a slight operationalpreference for Blue as "repeat the command with the same operands" (I do a fairnumber of repeated substutions, changing only the selection in between), and aslight explanatory preference for Blue as "Red followed by Yellow," so won'tscream loudly if either interpretation is picked (consistently).Blue Get, etc., requires an additional confirmation if there is an undeliveredmessage, which is consistent with either interpretation.Jim H.*start*00610 00024 US Date: 21 April 1981 10:48 am PST (Tuesday)Sender: McKeeman.PASubject: Laurel DocumentationTo: BrotzFrom: McKeemanFor your pleasure.					mouse					 ........					 ||					 ||					 ''''''''		Left			Middle			Right		Red			Yellow			Blue		-----------------------------------------------------		select			select				extend		chr/line		word/para			selectionshift		select			select				extend		chr/line		word/para			source		as source		as source			selectioncontrol	select			select				extend		chr/line		word/para			deletion		for deletion		for deletion			selection*start*00756 00024 US Date: 22 April 1981 12:39 pm PST (Wednesday)Sender: McKeeman.PASubject: Laurel Matrix, forgot a lineTo: Brotz, BurstallFrom: McKeeman				   mouse				    L M R				   \  |  /					 ........					 ::					 ::					 ''''''''		Left			Middle			Right		Red			Yellow			Blue		-----------------------------------------------------		select			select				extend		chr/line		word/para			selectionshift		select			select				extend		chr/line		word/para			source		as source		as source			selectioncontrol	select			select				extend		chr/line		word/para			deletion		for deletion		for deletion			selectionshift/		select			select				extendcontrol	chr/line		word/para			move		for move		for move			selection*start*01833 00024 US Date: 23 April 1981 11:07 am PST (Thursday)From: Brotz.PASubject: Re: Laurel.profileIn-reply-to: Your message of 23 April 1981 1:35 pm EST (Thursday)To: SLAWECKIcc: BrotzTry this one.Registry: PAHardcopy: WindfallEditor: modelessErrorKeys: LaurelXFont: 0 TimesRoman 10Font: 5 Helvetica 12 BFont: 6 TimesRoman 12 BFont: 9 HyType 11HardcopyForm: InternalMemo 25730 2540 3500 19050 0 T (Options  (Caption 900 26670 5 T XEROX)  (Caption 3500 26670 6 T "Network Mail")  (Heading 3500 26670 0 F Subject 15875)  (PageNumber 18415 26670 0 F) ) (Rows  (0 0 35 (Field 3500 10795 0 4 T F 3500 To "" T F T F)    (Field 12065 19050 0 4 T F 12065 From "" T F T F) )  (420 22220 35 (Field 3500 10795 0 4 T F 3500 Subject "" T F T F)    (Field 12065 19050 0 4 T F 12065 Date "" T F T F) )  (0 0 0 (Field 3500 19050 0 4 F F 4165 PrintForm "" F T T T) )  (420 0 35 (OtherFields 3500 19050 0 4 T F 3500 420) )  (1000 0 35 (Field 3500 19050 0 4 T F 3500 In-Reply-To "" F F T F) )  (2000 0 35 (Body 3500 19050 0) )  (420 0 35 (Field 3500 19050 0 4 F F 4165 c cc F F T T) ) )HardcopyForm: HyType 24730 2540 2500 20000 0 T (Options  (Caption 2500 25670 9 T "Laurel HyType Message")  (Heading 2500 25670 9 F Subject 15875)  (PageNumber 18415 25670 9 F) ) (Rows  (0 0 106 (Field 2500 11000 9 9 T T 2500 To "" T F T F)    (Field 11500 20000 9 9 T T 11500 From "" T F T F) )  (420 22220 106 (Field 2500 11000 9 9 T T 2500 Subject "" T F T F)    (Field 11500 20000 9 9 T T 11500 Date "" T F T F) )  (0 0 0 (Field 2500 20000 9 9 F T 2500 PrintForm "" F T T T) )  (420 0 106 (OtherFields 2500 20000 9 9 T T 2500 420) )  (1000 0 106 (Field 2500 20000 9 9 T T 2500 In-Reply-To "" F F T F) )  (2000 0 106 (Body 2500 20000 9) )  (420 0 106 (Field 2500 20000 9 9 F T 3300 c cc F F T T) ) )*start*00334 00024 US Date: 24 April 1981 3:58 pm PST (Friday)From: Horning.paSubject: "delivered"To: Brotzcc: LaurelImp^Doug,Remember this message, which replaces Deliver in the menu after delivery?It's kind of hard to see these days.

WhileI quite agree with all your comments on dl behavior, I must express my strongdisagreement with your advice on dealing with misaddressed messages.  Assomeone with a mailbox which is occasionally confused with another, I feelqualified to say that people in my situation would suffer from others adhering toyour standard.For one thing, it is NOT all that presumptuous to suppose you know the mailboxof the correct recipient.  People rapidly become very familiar with all themailboxes which can be confused with theirs.  Many times there is only onepossible confusee, as in my case.  But if a new Pettit variant came on the laurelscene, I'm sure I would know his/her full name, organizational placement, andgeneral project area within hours of the first misaddressed message I received forhim/her.  Often messages start with a first name salutation, which is usuallyenough to disambiguate them without reading the contents at all.  Other times,the sender or other recipients are sufficient information.  In cases where it isunclear who the intended recipient is, your advice is fine, but I contend thatthose cases are mighty rare.Secondly, while I agree with you that it is important that the sender find outwhen a message was improperly addressed, a copy to the sender of the forwardedmessage should be sufficient warning.Thirdly, and most important, messages very often have time value.  And manypeople only read their system mail once or twice a day.  Messages sent to thewrong person have already incurred some delay.  If people were to returnmisaddressed messages to the sender, they might very well incur an additionalday or two of delay.  If the sender (but not the intended recipient) is away on atrip or home sick, the delay could be weeks, and an important message might notget through on time.Phil Petit rather frequently receives messages for me, usually from people whoknow the correct spelling of my name but who simply mistyped it.  I appreciatehis forwarding them to me immediately, and hope he continues to do so.  I willcontinue to forward those I receive for Phil to him.	Teri PettitP.S.  As you like analogies, I would contend that most misaddressed laurelmessages are analogous to letters which arrive in the post for a former roommate,whose new address you know.  In those cases, you do not mark out the addressand let the post office figure out what to do.  You substitute the new address andmark Please Forward.*start*00354 00024 US Date: 12 May 1981 11:51 am PDT (Tuesday)From: Petit.PASubject: Re: Wrong numbers in LaurelIn-reply-to: Pettit's message of 12 May 1981 10:49 am PDT (Tuesday)To: Pettitcc: Brotz, PetitYes, I certainly intend to continue forwarding any of your mail which I get, inspite of what anyone tells me I should do instead.--Phil*start*00422 00024 US Date: 12 May 1981 1:46 pm PDT (Tuesday)From: Horning.paSubject: Laurel 6.1 Suggestion: Hardcopy - Printer, Form, Copies, etc.To: Brotzcc: HorningDoug,It would be nice if the submenu command brackets had the same "autoscrolling"feature on Red as other brackets, so one could simply hold down Red to see thechoices.Autoscrolling (or clicking Red on) Copies should just count up.Jim H.*start*00340 00024 US Date: 12 May 1981 2:50 pm PDT (Tuesday)From: Woods.PASubject: To: BrotzI've haven't had time to do more than skim the Laurel 6 manual, but in doing soI saw nothing about the various interesting characters available, and I thinkthey would have stood out enough to notice.

When the Printer is Local,if the Form brackets are empty, then the HyType hardcopy form is used, if theForm brackets are non-empty, then the specified form is used.You may specify Printer: Local in the profile if that is your default printer. (Printer: is a synonym for Hardcopy: in the profile.)  The hardcopy submenualways overrides the profile.The possibilities for rampant confusion thus abound.  The problem is that onemust specify two things when printing, the printer and the form.  I choose tomake the Printer dominant, i.e., when you choose Printer {Local}, then thedefault hardcopy form changes to HyType, whereas when you choose the Printerto be anything else, the default hardcopy form is the one listed in your profile. Just setting Form {HyType} without setting Printer {Local} will result in theHyType form used on the Printer specified, which is likely to be a Spruceprinter (Penguin, Dover, etc.)So, the profile settings should bePrinter: PreferredPrinter, Local or PenguinNameDefaultHardcopyForm: Preferred form for the Spruce printerand the Form {} option should be left alone.  Then when printing on the Spuceprinter, the DefaultHardcopyForm from the profile is used, and when printing onthe Local (HyType) printer, the HyType form is used.This is not explained too thoroughly in the Laurel manual, so you may want tosave this message.-- Doug*start*05803 00024 US Date: 12 May 1981 12:16 pm PDT (Tuesday)Sender: Brotz.PASubject: Laurel 6 is releasedTo: AllEOS^.eos, AllXRCC^.xrccFrom: Brotz.pa, Schroeder.pa, Levin.pa, Birrell.pacc: LaurelSupport.paReply-To: LaurelSupport.paThis message announces the release of "Laurel 6" to message system users in theEOS and XRCC registries.  Users of all previous versions of Laurel, XLaurel,and LaurelX should convert to Laurel 6 as soon as possible.  Previous versionsare no longer supported, and may stop working due to changes in the messagetransport system.  Laurel 6 will run on all Alto configurations that could runLaurel 5.1 or LaurelX and on all Dolphins and Dorados in Alto emulation mode.If you encounter any problems with Laurel 6 please send a message toLaurelSupport.PA.UPDATING TO LAUREL 6Laurel 6 is stored in the <Laurel> directory on the following file servers:     RoseBowl -- In Pasadena, Net 40     Aklak -- In Toronto, Net 33To convert from an earlier version of Laurel to Laurel 6:    1.  Pick the server nearest (in the Internet) to your customary workstation.    2.  Retrieve (with FTP) the file "<Laurel>Laurel.cm" from that server.    3.  Type "@Laurel.cm@ to the Alto executive.If you are not a current user of Laurel, but wish to try Laurel 6, then follow thesame instructions, but use the command file "<Laurel>LaurelNewUser.cm".FOR USERS OF Laurel 6T*'sSome of you have been testing pre-release versions of Laurel 6 for us.  These areidentified by the herald "Laurel 6T*", for * IN [1..42].  It is important that youalso convert to the "official" released version of Laurel 6.  You should also makesure that you have the most recent versions of the Runnable ".Laurel" files.  Theeasiest way to be sure is to present the following command to the Alto executive:     FTP server dir/c Laurel ret/c Laurel.run ret/u *.Laurelwhere "server" is chosen as above.FOR USERS OF LaurelXLaurelX is an ASD-produced version of Laurel 5.1 that contains a BravoX-styleeditor.  (Do not confuse this with XLaurel, which is a version of Laurel 5.1designed to run on extended memory Altos.) To make the Laurel 6 editor similarto the LaurelX editor, add the following line to your Laurel profile:        Editor: modelessand then restart Laurel 6.DOCUMENTATIONComplete documentation for Laurel 6 exists as the file <Laurel>Laurel.press oneach of the above servers.  THIS MANUAL HAS 112 PAGES!  DON'T TRY TOPRINT IT ON YOUR LOCAL PRINTER DURING NORMAL WORKING HOURS. We suggest that each organization arrange to reproduce hard copies of thismanual for local distribution.  Users should wait for an announcement from theirlocal support organization that copies of the manual are available.   The Laurel 6user interface is generally upward compatible with previous versions of Laurel. Users of previous versions should have no trouble using Laurel 6. (The Laurel 6 manual comes in two parts, Laurel.press and LaurelScreen.press. Both should be printed and the second inserted after the table of contents in thefirst.  The manual is laid out for two-sided printing.  A separate file containingonly the modeless editor summary at the end of the Laurel manual is also storedon EditSummary.press.)SUMMARY OF CHANGESThe facilities available in Laurel 5.1 and LaurelX have been merged in Laurel 6. Where features of those two systems were in conflict, there is usually a profileoption in Laurel 6 that chooses between them.  Laurel 6 also has a significantnumber of changes and improvements over Laurel 5.1 and LaurelX.The profile options Authenticate:, Herald:, HeraldFont:, Logo:, LogoFont:, Poll:,and DisplayErrorPups: are no longer recognized by Laurel.  The Authenticate:option has been subsumed by the Registry: entry in your profile.  The otherentries that deal with hardcopy options are subsumed by more general hardcopyforms.The arrangement of screen commands has been altered slightly from previousversions of Laurel.  The Delete command has been moved next to the Displaycommand, with the Hardcopy command now placed at the right margin.  The{brackets} for several commands, e.g., for Get and Put, are now located on asecond menu line that only becomes visible when you need it.  Just invokethese commands in the normal way; their {brackets} will appear automatically.The Laurel editor now comes in two flavors, modal and modeless.  The modaleditor is similar to the editor in Laurel 5.1; the modeless editor is similar to theone in LaurelX.  A large number of new editor commands are available in eithereditor.  By default, you get the modal editor.A new kind of selection, called shifted selection, is an alternative to type-in,whether you use the old-style editor or the newer modeless editor.  At any timethat Laurel expects type-in, you may hold down SHIFT, make a selection andthen lift up SHIFT.  The selection will be copied as though you had just typedit, and you may continue type-in.New screen commands, Copy and Run, are available.  Copy provides FTP-likeservices for both local and remote files.  Run allows you to run various programswhile still in Laurel.  These programs exist as *.laurel files on the <Laurel>directories.  By editing your Laurel profile (using Bravo or laurel) to include theline          RunPath: [server]<Laurel>(where "server" is the one you chose from the list above), you will tell Laurel toretrieve these programs when you first invoke them.  The program Chat.laurel,for example, turns your bottom window into a Chat typescript.  To try it(assuming that you've added "RunPath ... " to your profile and restarted Laurel),invoke the "Run" command, enter the word Chat into its brackets, and connect orlogin to your favorite server.*start*00481 00024 US Date: 8 May 1981 1:46 pm PDT (Friday)From: Brotz.PASubject: Re: Laurel 6 release for Laurel 6T usersTo: @Laurel6.dlcc: BrotzReply-To: BrotzThe command line given in the release message for upating to Laurel 6 was inerror.The correct command line isFTP/-e server dir/c Laurel ret/u *.laurelThis will update all of your official *.laurel programs without distrubing anyunofficial ones that you may have.Sorry for any inconvenience.-- Doug*start*00245 00024 US Date: 19 May 1981 12:02 pm PDT (Tuesday)To: MeFrom: MeSubject: Laurel 6 file sizeLaurel 5.1 is 403 pages.

The following commands work the way one would expect.	a - appends same text to current selection	b - brackets current selection	d - deletes current selection again	i - inserts same text in from of current selection	r - replaces current selection with same text	t - inserts time stamp in from of current selectionThe following commands work other than one would expect.	e - executes last editing command according to rules above		recommended action:  None (repeat of "e" is a NOP)	f - executes last editing command according to rules above		recommended action: Search forward from the current selection to		find the next occurance of the text string	s - replaces current selection with text which was selected at the end of	    the last "s" command		recommended action: re-execute substitute logic using the current		selection and the same values for old and new text strings as were		used on the "s" command just done	u - undoes the last editing command		recommended action: reject undo after e, f, s, g, and p, and leave		processing of ESC after "u" as is.	g - looks like the text insertion of a get acts as a repeatable command, but		it is not redoing a Get using the current selection		recommeded action: reject ESC after g	p - executes last editing command according to rules above		recommeded action: reject ESC after pIf the last command was rejected with an error message, reject the ESC, ratherthan go back to a command which preceeded the operator error.Of all these recommendations, the one which is the most useful would be torepeat a Find.

You can thank the Alto OS not keeping file types plus Maxc caringabout them.Copy sends files to Maxc as binary files.  Laurel does not read through the entirefile to discover if it is text the way FTP does.A text or binary file stored on Maxc is Copy'd to the Alto correctly, as Maxcknows the type and the Alto doesn't care.Put in Laurel stores on Maxc as a text file.If your file is less than 64K characters and is text, then you can store it throughLaurel by Get'ting and Put'ting.  If the file is over 64K characters and is binary,you can store it on Maxc with the Laurel Copy command.

So I invoked MailFile on [Ivy]<CSL-notebook>Notebook-index.mail. It worked like a charm.A while later, I began wondering where Laurel had put the TOC.  I huntedaround and finally found it -- on [Ivy]<CSL-Notebook> !  This worked onlybecause I am a wheel on Ivy and can create files anywhere.So I continued the experiment by disabling my Ivy wheel status and tryingagain.  This time, MailFile on [Ivy]<CSL-notebook>Notebook-index.mail yieldedthe rather strange error message "Disk errors.  Get mail file failed."It seems to me that if a remote mail file is read-only to me, and there isn'talready a TOC, Laurel should build the TOC either on my local disk or on myown directory on the file server.  Also, it should delete the TOC when it is done,since a private copy of a TOC for a shared mail file is not very interesting.	Ed*start*01734 00024 US Date: 2 June 1981 11:39 am EDT (Tuesday)From: SLAWECKI.PASubject: Re: Laurel installationIn-reply-to: Brotz's message of 1 June 1981 2:30 pm PDT (Monday)To: Brotzcc: Slawecki, McCaneyDoug, all went well with the users to whom I gave Laurel 6, which would beabout 50% of the population.  The rest will be upgraded when I have the newrelease of BravoX for them.  Those using Laurel 6 are as enthusiastic about it as Iam.The only problem that came up with at Corporate and that was that users therego to LaurelX from Bravo without saving a document on the screen.  Then,when one quit from LaurelX, one would be dropped back into Bravo with theunsaved document on the screen.  However, Laurel 6 takes one back to theExecutive and the unsuspecting user loses the document.I checked with Steve Glassman about this and he told me that Laurel 6 doesn'tsupport fast swapping.  This will not be a problem with the new software, andwith users having old software, I will have to remove the "Laurel" button fromthe configfile.I've been out of town, but I remember I had asked you about the defaultPenguin printer hardcopy form.  The form that comes out is what Laurel seemsto call Internal Memo form.  The form I would like to make default is whatLaurel calls the Network Mail form (it more closely approximates the Memo formswe use here).  I assumed I could change it somewhere in the profile, but I wasunsuccessful.

I am pleased to see the topic catching yourattention and grateful for the exposure it gives to our new programme.  I hopeyou do not mind my giving you my reactions your article and some thoughts Ihave had on the same subject.  It is intended to help you in your doublydifficult task of documenting, as an outsider, something only beginning to beunderstood by insiders.I try to stay aware of the meaning of the title:  Engineer, "one who appliesingenuity", and Software, which was a catchy way to say not-hardware, andreally signifies the information held in, and processed by, the hardware.In contrast to the undifferentiated skill set of		programming+hardware design+systems engineeringyou postulated, we at WIGS have decided that a Software Engineer must befirstly skilled in programming and also, but secondarily, know enough abouthardware, computer application areas, and managing people to produce highquality systems of programs.  It is my personal conviction that what we will do isbetter modelled by a medical school than an academic curriculum in ComputerScience.A major difficulty faced by the software engineer is an unusual need forbreadth.  As you note, inexorably computers are going to be everywhere.  It isnot likely that a single Software Engineer is going to be a robotics expert,proficient in business data processing, a network communications analyst, asolver of integral equations and a VLSI designer.  We will, as do our medicalanalogs, have specialties.  Our approach at WIGS is to define a core curriculumaround the universal skills we all need, and then differentiate with electives andproject courses to help our students develop one or more specialties. ( I willarrange for a pile of material representing the present state of the curriculum tobe sent to you.)Changing the subject, I quote from my recent letter to Harlan Mills, on the topicof management skills for Software Engineers:"One management problem arises in that complexity drives us to using teams.  Nomatter what the tolerance for complexity some (perhaps remarkable) individualhas, (we know now that) there are much lower limits on the acceptablecomplexity of the interactions within teams.  This has led to the anomaly ofsystems that can be built well by one person, or many people, but by no size ofteam in between.  It seems to me that the management curriculum must focus onthose techniques that we have found close the anomalous gap.  Of course,complex systems are going to be built in any case; the measure of success of themanagement techniques is the quality of the resulting product.The problem is in a sense recursive; the production of automated managementtools is within our technical expertise.  We apply our own wares to our ownproblems.  For example, I regard the cost models from TRW, and variousintegration and testing tools as within the nascent management curriculum."A characteristic of information systems which is well-known, but frequentlyignored is that, like buildings, one expects to change them over a period of time. An architect would not call adding a wing to his hospital "maintenance".  In theanalogous situation, we software engineers do.  The important thing is not, ofcourse, the words used, but the preparations made.  Making a system modifiableis much harder than just making it work.Valuing software is another dimly understood area where we must developexpertise.  Software has cost to build, cost to replace, market value, rental value,(perhaps) taxable assessed value, and so on.  Although we have a good deal oftolerance now, in the longer run the software engineer must be able to makeclosely reasoned economic decisions.Well, I can obviously go on at length.  The details are not the point of my letterto you.  Rather I hope to reinforce the seriousness with which we regard the taskof building the practice of Software Engineering.  It's short history is admirablyexposed by Professor Hoare in his Turing Lecture (see the February 81Communications of the ACM).  I summarize it all by Thoreau's dictum"Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!".  						Cordially,						W. M.

The training files are different for Laurel 5.1 andLaurel 6, and their last messages (the ones that say "Add me to LaurelUsers ... ")are different.The current training file is named Tutorial.mail.  The obsolete one was namedHelp.mail.  The Help.mail's are cropping up from a variety of sources including:1.  The <Laurel> directories on your IFS's.  There should be a Tutorial.mail, not    a Help.mail on these directories.2.  From Basic Disks (Basic Non-Programmer's Disk, etc.), including those stored    on IFS's and those kept as standard initial disks in many locations.3.  From "helpful" users' disks.  These helpers initiate a new user to Laurel with    a "You probably would like this Help.mail file from my disk that I've been    saving for years."When Laurel 6 was released, the Laurel group took great pains to store theLaurel files on each IFS consistently.  We did not update any Basic Disks at thattime, since they are controlled by individual administrators.  Since then, entropyhas been working its nefarious deeds.Please examine any directories under your control to insure that Laurel 6, notLaurel 5.1 is there.  The creation date for both Laurel.run and Laurel.imageshould be 6-May-81.  Also make sure that Tutorial.mail is there, not Help.mail. Please do the same for any Basic Disks under your control.

Pier & D. BrotzTo: LaurelUsers^cc: LaurelSupportReply-To: Pier, LaurelSupportHave you ever wanted to print a remote bravo or text file in two-up landscapemode?  Do you like living dangerously?  If so, read on.Ken Pier has modified the famous Murray-Johnsson-Ayers Print.bcd program sothat it can run in Laurel 6.  Some modifications were absolutely necessary, suchas making Print accept its commands via typein rather than from the commandline.  Others were highly desirable, such as making Print think that it didn'town the entire machine.  We believe that most of the bugs are gone, however, itonly takes one ...[Ivy]<Laurel>Print.laurel is the program.  If this initial release works smoothly,we will store Print.laurel on other file servers as well.  Send your comments toLaurelSupport.pa and/or Pier.pa.Caution: Print.laurel will not print the current mail file.  To print that file,invoke Mail file on some other mail file first.  If your machine has only onebank of memory, good luck.  The rest of this message is taken from Ken Pier'sdescription of the program.CAVEATSPrint is old and dirty code. I don't intend to improve or rework it any more.Doug Brotz and I will entertain bug and feature reports, but no guarantees areexpressed or implied.If you print more than 127 printed pages, Print will barf. Also, under somecircumstances, having run Print you will not be able to run any more programswithout restarting Laurel. This is the motivation for the /~m feature, see below,which reduces the likelihood of restarting.Ken----------------------------------------------------------------------------[IVY]<Pier>LaurelPrint.doc				11 Aug. 1981Print is a program to generate Press format filesand send them to your local printer.  It is handy for generatingcode listings since it will print files in 2 column landscape mode.[IVY]<Pier>Print.laurel is a version of this program that will runin the Laurel composition window.Command format:Activate Print with the Laurel Run button. Type a command line terminatedby ESC. "<filename1> <filename2> <filename3>"  just prints the specifiedfiles on the printer specified in the HARDCOPY section of your User.cm.Multiple files are batched to be sent to the printer as long as the fontsare the same.  If a file is already in Press format it will be sent directlyto the printer. Typing DEL and being patient will abort in midstream.A <filename> may be a complete remote file name, in which case the file will beFTP'ed to your local disk (onto the file PRINT.TEMP$) and printed from there. This local temporary file will be deleted after printing."Print /b ..."  Shifts to Bravo mode.  (There is no way to get outof it.)  This processes only a subset of Bravo formatting (tabs, fonts and faces).It uses the fonts specified in the BRAVO section of your User.cm.Switches:/a		Print headers on each page (default true; -a disables)./z		Print trailers on each page (default true; -z disables).<host>/h	Directs the output to <host>.<output>/o	Creates a press file in <output> (defaulting .press).		Disables transmission to printer.<font>/f	Changes the font to <font> for the following files.  The		default is Gacha8 in portrait; Gacha6 in landscape./c<n>		Sets number of copies to <n> (default 1)./t<n>		Changes the tab stops to <n> spaces (default 8)./l<n>		Landscape mode.  <n> is the number of columns (default 2)./p<n>		Portrait mode.  <n> is the number of columns (default 1)./s<n>		Number of sides.  <n> IN[0..2]; 0=> use printer default./m  		Messages. /-m or /~m turns off "progress" messages in the                Laurel window. This is useful when large numbers of files                are being Pressed.The switches that don't need a string as an argument will also work inlocal mode.  Local switches appearing after the argument is "used up"are global.  Defaults are:  Gacha6/fl2s2c1azt8mExamples:	 Foo	 Foo/l	 /l Foo1 Foo2	 /c3 Foo1 Foo2/l3 TimesRoman10BI/f Foo3/l	 Foo1/p2 Foo2/b         /-m Foo1 Foo2 Foo3 Foo4 Foo5 Foo6 Foo7 /m Foo8Richard Johnsson wrote the front end, Bob Ayers wrote the Bravo formatterand Hal Murray wrote the Presser.

I strongly suggest that you remove these parts of the manual whenyou translate it into Swedish, as they will at best be confusing to yourcustomers, and they may press you for installation of those features.These references are most prevalent in sections 2, 3.1.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3, 3.7.6, 5.2, 6, 7,8, 9, Appendix B.2, Appendix D, and Appendix E.

The Laurel6-n.bravo refers to chapter orAppendix n, where chapter 4 had to be split into two halves due to its largesize.  Laurel6-toc.bravo is the table of contents, which you will certainly have tomodify to reflect your new manual.The .bravo files have been tuned with Look Keep's and Page Breaks to obtain thefinal layout.  Each chapter begins on a right-hand page, and the precedingchapter may have been padded out with a blank page to insure this,  When youedit the files, these fine tunings will get in your way.There are corresponding .press files for each of the source files listed above.These files represent the final version of the Laurel Manual that is currently inthe pipeline for publication as a PARC/CSL Blue&White report, not the versionthat was widely distributed throught Xerox last May.

Unfortunately there has beenlittle systematic study of the use and impacts of these developments.Design and implementation are often more driven by thecharacteristics of new technology than the needs of users.At Xerox, the opportunity exists to carefully examine the useand impacts of one such new office technology: electronic mail.A brief summary of such a study's focus and methods is providedbelow.Focus of Study     The Laurel messaging system was introduced at Xerox severalyears ago.  Since then much anecdotal evidence has been gatheredabout its use.  One study, conducted by Chuck Henderson, clearlyillustrates the potential of electronic mail to create wide rangingsocial and behavioral impacts in the office.  What is now neededis a more quantitative approach, which not only uncovers areas whereimpacts might lie, but also can highlight the direction andmagnitude of these impacts.  In particular, the study should provideinformation in three major areas:    1.  USES.  How the system is used must be carefully analyzed.        Frequency of use, facilities that are used or not used, who is        communicating with whom, what tasks are accomplished, in        what situations is the system used, etc. are all types of        information that will highlight potential impacts.    2.  IMPACTS.  Certain patterns of use will lead to different        kinds of impacts.  These should included both perceived        impacts of the system as well as externally observed impacts.        Perceived impacts include:  User judgements of impacts        on work efficiency and effectiveness, job satisfaction,        perceived changes in communication behaviors, etc.        Unobtrusive measures of actual impacts may include changes        in the communication patterns; i.e. who communicates with        whom, the frequency of interaction, the number of different        contacts, turnover and absenteeism, mobility in the         company in terms of promotions, etc.    3.  FACTORS PREDICTING USES AND THEIR IMPACTS.  In particular,        demographic characteristics of users, user attitudes and        expectations, characteristics of their jobs/tasks, as well        as department and organization variables all may play        a part in explaining/predicting uses and impacts.     By examining the relationships between these sets of variablesit is possible to gain an understanding of the impacts of electronic mail that might vary considerably from the imagesgleaned from the anecdotal evidence.  Statistical analysis can helpuncover relationships which are not intuitively obvious.     There are potentially hundreds of impacts of electronic mailuse.  This study will focus on those impacts which appear to haverelevance to the question of productivity, directly or indirectly.Benefits of the Proposed Study to Xerox     The proposed research will benefit Xerox in two critical areas:design and implementation.  These are briefly addressed below.     Design       Designers are continuously working to improve the utility of the Laurel messaging system.   Armed with such data as features which work or don't work, types of uses to which the system isput, and uses which are associated with negative consequences,these designers will be better able to provide a system which more closely meets the needs of end users.     Implementation     Little is known about the most appropriate strategies forintroducing electronic mail systems.  Relating user, usage, andimpact data can assist in the development of effective implementationstrategies.  For example, users with certain job characteristicsmight have unique needs for a messaging system, and thus requirean orientation which is tailored to these needs.  In addition,it may be the case that behaviors thought to be inappropriate(i.e. game playing, use for personal correspondence) actuallyhave positive consequences for individual users and the organizationas a whole.  Knowledge of these instances would be invaluablein the development of successful implementation strategies.General Research Methodology     The proposed study would follow a sequence of phases commonto field research endeavors.  By field research it is meantthat actual behaviors in a field setting form the core of dataupon which the study is based.  The phases include:     1.  IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS.  Interviews with system designers        and users would be used to obtain very textured information        about both system use and organizational "culture".  This        information would then be used to development more         quantitative instruments which are both meaningful and         relevant to potential respondents.  These interviews can        also provide information regarding the availability of         existing sources of relevant data, including company        records, prior studies, system logs, etc.    2.  RESEARCH DESIGN.  After interviews are conducted, a detailed        research design can be developed.  Specifically, sampling        strategies, data collection methods, and data analysis        strategies can be planned.  Data collection and analysis        are briefly addressed below.  The sampling plan will be        devised with study objectives in mind.  Ideally a         representative sample of users and non-users would be        included in the study.  The inclusion of a control group        of non-users would permit much stronger statements about        the impacts of electronic mail by allowing many alternative        rival hypotheses to be ruled out.    3.  DATA COLLECTION.  While methods of data collection cannot        be specified until existing sources of data are carefully        evaluated, a general strategy can be outlined.  A        multi-operational approach to data collection will be        used.  That is, each single method of collecting data         suffers from unique strengths as well as weaknesses.        By incorporating several methods, strengths can be        capitalized upon while protecting against weaknesses.        Among methods likely to be employed are questionnaires        for obtaining user attitudes and perceptions, system logs        for obtaining usage data, and company records for obtaining        other user information.  In all cases, privacy and        confidentiality of respondents will be guarded.  Respondents        will be assured that responses will not be released,        except in statistical summary.  In addition, wherever         possible, the burden of effort on respondents will be        minimized.  A final guideline for data collection is that        whenever possible, the system itself will be used as a        medium for gathering information.    4.  DATA ANALYSIS.  Multivariate statisical procedures will        be used to test hypotheses.      Prior to each phase in the study, project advisors at Xeroxwould be consulted.  In addition, instruments for data collection would be carefully pretested.Products     A report will be presented to Xerox study advisors thatdescribes in full detail the study's findings and methodology.All technical data regarding system facilities and hardware willbe treated as proprietary, and the organization will not beidentified by name in any reports.  I would obtain companyapproval before publishing any results, with the exception ofmy dissertation.  This document will also treat system facilitiesand hardware information as proprietary and will not identifythe organization by name.Costs, Time Frame, and Next Steps     In return for the conduct of the proposed research, I askonly for coverage of the research expenses.  This would includematerials and supplies, system use, travel expenses if needed,etc.  No salary would be necessary.  My motivation for carryingout this research is to complete the requirements for mydoctoral dissertation at the Annenberg School of Communications.I believe that the proposed project would satisfy academicrequirements, be intellectually stimulating, and be useful foryour organization.  Furthermore, it would give me the opportunityto conduct research in an area which I find fascinating and drastically in need of empirical study.     The time frame for the proposed research is constrained onlyby my desire to finish my doctoral studies by June of 1982.In order to meet this deadline, work on a more detailedproposal should commence as soon as possible....Chip Steinfield------------------------------------------------------------*start*00404 00024 US Date: 16 Sept. 1981 8:53 am EDT (Wednesday)From: TELLEX.HenrSubject: Re: Add to @LaurelUsersIn-reply-to: Brotz.PA's message of 15 Sept. 1981 9:42 am PDT (Tuesday)To: Brotz.PAcc: TELLEX, LaurelSupport.PAMy disk was created by Gerry VerSchage.

Most of these are probably old hat to you butsince I don't know the "conventional wisdom" I thought I'd just forward themanyway.Browsing in Laurel-1.	I seem to occasionally have difficulty getting Yellow recognized on the	browse line... I think this is particularly true in the middle window.	Perhaps the Yellow target area could be broadened a little.2.	I would like to be able to place some marks that show up on the browse	line.  For example, I find myself putting text, schedules, notes about	publications etc. into the same document and it would be very nice if	I could "jump" to the right spots a little easier than just taking a blind	stab at the thing.3.	By the way I would now agree that browsing the Laurel way is easier	than in Bravo (at least for me).ModeLess Editor1.	I switched to the modeless editor in order to try it, and I think you are	quite right about it.  Although I occasionally forget, on the whole it is	easier to use, and I suspect that I have really only scratched the surface	of the capabilities.Enhancements1.	It might be nice if some programs prepared their output in the "form" of a	mail message for processing via Laurel.  A trivial example might be a	program which prepared a nice report on your file status in the form of	a memo rather than as FILES.LAUREL seems to do it.  On our mail system	I get a lot of "automated" reports from status perusing programs this way	I find it very comfortable.2.	We implemented a moderately useful facility called "Response Mail". This	logically looks a lot like me sending you a "form" for you to fill out and	return to me.  Perhaps there is some way of doing this that I haven't run	into yet.3.	Notes formatted like this one (indented paragraphs, hanging numbers to	the left) are not uncommon.  Some way of setting a left margin via a	Ruler or the like would be nice in the Laurel Editor, although again it 	may exist and I just don't know about it.Error Situations1.	I have encountered "Format error in mail file, get failed" after creating	(an undoubtedly illegal) mail file by "hand".  If there is a scavenger that	might have helped me, it would have been nice to have been told.*start*01495 00024 US Date: 28 Sept. 1981 1:58 pm PDT (Monday)From: Fikes.PASubject: Re: Outside people on internal distribution listsIn-reply-to: Schroeder's message of 25 Sept. 1981 3:40 pm PDT (Friday)To: Schroedercc: Brotz, Card, Birrell, Taft, Levin, Owners-CognitiveInterest^Reply-To: FikesAs the owner of CognitiveInterest^, I have encouraged the inclusion on thatdistribution list of non-Xerox people in the Palo Alto area who are interested inour Cognitive Science Discussion Group (CSDG) seminars.  That policy isconsistent with that of other AI groups in the area who run similar seminars(e.g., Stanford's SIGLUNCH series), and I think it helps to foster communicationand cooperation among the groups.  An example of the type of situation I thinkwe should strive to avoid occured a few years ago when Ed Feigenbaumexpressed his anger to me about Stanford not receiving notices of a talk that AlNewell had given at PARC.I also understand there are situations in which distribution to non-Xerox folks isinappropriate.  Therefore, I suggest that all non-Xerox people be removed fromCognitiveInterest^ and that a new dl be established, say calledCognitiveInterestAndFriends^, that is a superset of CognitiveInterest^ containingboth the internal and external folks.  (I will volunteer to help make thosechanges.)  The new list would then be used for announcement of open CSDG's. And for other uses, people could use whichever list suits their needs.richard   *start*00480 00024 US Date: 4 Nov. 1981 1:03 pm PST (Wednesday)From: Ritchie.PASubject: Laurel Manual SuggestionTo: BrotzDoug,As I mentioned, the manual is exceptionally well done.

For example, suppose you want to change "" to "bell","" to "whistle", "developement" to "development", and ".  " to " stop "throughout a great many files.  The COM S substitute command would have tobe used four times on each file, and the substitution arguments would have tobe retyped each time.  Using the new substitute program, you can proceed morerapidly as follows:First type into the bottom window the following colorful display:developmentdevelopement stop .  bellwhistle(This is the style in which you list all the substitutions that you wish toperform.  The laurel cherry character is typed as control-C; it is used to delimitthe patterns and replacements, since it is unlikely to be needed within them.)Then Run the InsertMail program; this will move the cherry stew into themiddle window, out of the way of the files that you will be bringing into thebottom window.For each file that you want to process, Get the file into the bottom window, Runthe program Substitute, and Put the file back (after checking that thesubstitutions performed as you expected).They will rarely perform as you expect.  For example, the substitutions abovewould transform a file consisting of the two sentences:	Developement of s and s proceeds apace.  Laurel soon to be morebaroque than Teco.into	developement of bells and whistles preceeds apace stop Laurel soon to bemore baroque than Teco.Note that the last period was not replaced, as it is at the end of the file and hasno spaces after it, and that the "D" has been demoted to a "d", probablyinadvertently.  Multiple global substitution schemes generally requiredebugging, which is convenient from within laurel, as the Forward commandwill move the substitution scheme back into the bottom window where it can beedited.The double quote character (") is reserved for quoting cherries or other doublequotes. A double quote is used instead of a single quote since single quotes areoften needed in the x's and y's, for example to get # or * or & to stand forthemselves in the pattern of the substitute command.  In summary:Let the contents of the middle window be	s0  x0  y0  s1  x1  y1   ...   xN  yN  sN+1where none of the x's or y's contains the cherry character or the doublequote character, and where none of the s's contains the cherry character.Then the effect of the program is the same as that of the following sequenceof Laurel substitute commands, performed in the order they are listed:Substitute x0 for y0Substitute x1 for y1...Substitute xN for yNThe s's are ignored; usually they are carriage returns or comments.If a double quote appears in one of the x's or y's, its only effect is to stripthe following character (presumably a cherry or double quote) of anyspecial lexical significance, so that the resulting x or y contains the following character and not the double quote.The s's must contain no cherries, not even quoted ones.If the contents of the middle window are not in the above form, or if oneof the x's or y's are longer than Laurel allows in its Substitute command, then an error message is given and the program exits to Laurel.This message itself is a valid substitution scheme (with unusually long s's); trymoving it into the middle window and applying it to the sentence above aboutlaurel and teco. ( = control G,  = control E).  The paragraph should betransformed as advertised.  In addition, the "No substitutions made" warningmessage will flash three times, because there are no occurences of "y0", "y1", or"yN" in the paragraph.The substitute command is now on [ivy]<GNelson>substitute.laurel.You might want to look over the mesa program there to see if I did anythingstupid.Greg*start*01191 00024 US Date: 7 Nov. 1981 2:54 pm PST (Saturday)From: Arndt.esSubject: Re: Kal.laurelTo: AllGames^cc: ArndtReply-To: ArndtSorry, I forgot to mention that the commands in Kal are Q (for quit; this requiresconfirmation, and once confirmed, Kal will ask you if you want to save theparameters) and ?

Important:this length includes the length of the stamp.  An Ascii space character comesnext, followed by another five Ascii digits describing the length of the stamp. This is nearly always 00024.  Another Ascii space character is followed by threecharacter whose meanings are:1) U for undeleted, D for deleted (you should never see a D here).2) S for seen, U for unseen.  The ? displayed in the mark field of the table ofcontents means this character = U.3) The mark character (other than ?) for this message.  In the example above themark character happens to be a blank.A carriage return completes the 24 characters of the standard stamp.The text of the message follows immediately, and the next stamp beginsimmediately after that message.  There are no padding bytes added anywhere;stamps and messages may begin or end on odd numbered bytes.The last character of the last message is the last character in the mail file.The format of the table of contents file is considerably more complicated.

It will prompt you for the name of a .alfile, and will then overwrite Laurel's standard display font with the font thatyou specify.  The new font must be no more than 12 pixels in height, and thecorresponding .al file must be no larger than Laurel10.al.  If either of theseconstraints are not met, SmashFont will complain.Be warned that it is rather easy to break Laurel by using SmashFont:  thefollowing scenario definitely kills Laurel, and other similar strategies could beinvented.  Display a message with a long window in the middle paragraph. Then use SmashFont to install a font whose characters are wider than those ofthe current font.  Scroll the middle window up a few lines, and then back down,and you're done:  Laurel is dead.  Thus, SmashFont is only recommended forsympathetic and expert users.In particular, I wrote SmashFont to be able to edit source files for the Sailimplementation of TEX in Laurel's bottom window (until I switch to Tioga forthis job).  To this end, I have used Prepress to produce two fonts that are knownto work with SmashFont:	Sorrel10.al  for people who like Laurel's current font (which 			is based on an old version of TimesRoman)	Xail10.al  for people who like the fixed-pitch Sail10.al, aka Gacha.Both of these have some of the SAIL special characters in the standard places:	infinity, partial, subset, superset, intersection, union, alignmentTab,	exchangeArrow, and forwardArrow;but no others (no room).  They also have distinct bitmaps for left and rightsingle quote, unlike Laurel10.al.  They have a down arrow, but it has beenmoved from its Sail home at ^A to the ^D slot instead, since ^A is hard to typein Laurel.Because of the different down arrow and the lack of the relational operators like"less than or equal to", you might want to \input a file like my ownLaurelEditing.tex at the start of your TEX file:\chcode'4_8  %make ^D also a subscript character\def\le{\mathrel\char'424 }  %ways to type the arithmetic relationals\def\ge{\mathrel\char'425 }\def\ne{\mathrel\char'434 }\def\lt{\mathrel\char'074 }  %just for symmetry\def\gt{\mathrel\char'076 }This stuff is on [Ivy]<Ramshaw>Laurel>  (or /Ivy/Ramshaw/Laurel/ dependingupon your religion):	SmashFont.Laurel	Laurel10.al	Sorrel10.al	Xail10.al	LaurelEditing.tex.I am willing to give short Prepress lessons to people who want to produce stillother fonts to use with Laurel via SmashFont,Lyle	*start*02181 00024 US Date: 20 Sept. 1982 10:27 am PDT (Monday)From: Brotz.PASubject: Re: Laurel ProgramsIn-reply-to: Gloger.es's message of 19 Sept. 1982 10:40 pm PDT (Sunday)To: Gloger.escc: Brotz, Neumeister.esConsider the following to be the document that describes how to write Laurelrunnable programs.Laurel will run Alto-Mesa programs that use IODefs for input and output andthat use any interfaces exported by the Mesa Nucleus.  PupDefs and FTPDefs arealso available, as are several Laurel internal interfaces, although the Laurelinterfaces are not documented.  Only the User half of FTPDefs is implemented,and only the Send half of EFTPDefs is implemented.Simple programs using only IODefs for interaction are easy to write and shouldrun in the same way both under Mesa.image and under Laurel.  Your program isstarted when the Run command is invoked, running your startup code.  Tofinish, just run off the end of the main line code in your startup module.  Donot call ImageDefs.StopMesa for obvious reasons, and do not add or deletecleanuip procedures.  If you use PupDefs, be sure not to turn the Pup Packageon or off (it's already on.)  Use Storage for allocating and freeing storage.  Laurelwill check your allocation, and will crash spectacularly if any allocated storageis not freed by the time your program finishes.The complete list of exports from Laurel is listed below.Laurel: CONFIGURATION  EXPORTS  -- from Mesa  AllocDefs, BcdOps, DirectoryDefs, DiskKDDefs, FrameDefs, FrameOps, FSPDefs,  ImageDefs, KeyDefs, MiscDefs, Process, ProcessDefs, Runtime, SegmentDefs,Storage,  StreamDefs, StreamScan, String, StringDefs, SystemDefs, Time, TimeDefs,  TrapDefs,   -- from Pup  BufferDefs, ByteBltDefs, CommUtilDefs, DriverDefs, EFTPDefs, PupDefs,  PupPktDefs, PupRouterDefs, PupStream, Stream,   -- from FTP  FTPDefs, TimeExtraDefs,   -- from Grapevine  LocateDefs, NameInfoDefs, NameInfoSpecialDefs, ProtocolDefs,  RetrieveDefs, SendDefs,   -- from Laurel  crD, csD, displayCommon, DMSTimeDefs, dsD, Editor, exD, inD, intCommon,  IODefs, LaurelExecDefs, lmD, MailParse, mfD, opD, prD, Sequin, tfD, tsD,vmD -- Doug*start*08962 00024 US Date: Wed, 9 Mar 83 17:50 PSTFrom: Brotz.PASubject: Laurel 6.1 changesTo: Schroeder, JWhite, Taft, Levincc: BrotzThis message contains all information about Laurel 6.1 that you will need to keepthe Laurel world going in my absence.USER PERCEIVABLE CHANGESLaurel 6.1's run file is 77 pages bigger than Laurel 6's.  This is mainly due tothe inclusion of VM, the ChollaCmd module, the ReplaceMailOp module, andgeneral ignoring of bit-bumming.Blue button New mail:  When invoked with the blue mouse button, Laurel willretrieve new mail one message at a time, checkpointing the mail file locally anddeleting the message on the server, until all mail is received or the local diskfills up.  A warning message appears if this New mail mode is invoked, requiringthe user to confirm that this slower than normal mail retrieval is actuallywanted.Arpa header standard:  Laurel 6.1 contains an RFC822-only header parser. Certain addresses acceptable in the past are no longer acceptable.  This will showup as the Answer command being unable to generate an answer form for thesenow illegal headers.  Laurel 6.1 will no longer append an Arpa host on outgoingmessages.  The Answer command may also be confused by legal headersproduced in the past that depended on Arpa host minimization algorithms, i.e.,the header    From: Brotz@PARC-MAXC    To: Foowill be answered as    cc: Foo.Arpasince the new parser understands that the sender was in the Arpa registry, andtherefore Foo must have been shorthand for Foo.Arpa.    Such cases should be rare.    The profile entry ArpaGatewayHostNames is no longer supported.CR insertion in Deliver:  Laurel 6.1 no longer automatically folds headers andplaces CR's in outgoing messages.  A new profile entry, DeliverWithCRs, isallowed, and is defaulted to FALSE.  If TRUE, Laurel 6.1 will insert CR's as inLaurel 6.  I would not advertise this feature.Display of long lines in the displayed message window:  This will go muchfaster in Laurel 6.1.  Pseudo-CR's are written into the mail file to achieve thisspeed-up.Remote file names:  In the profile entry RemoteFilePath, a $ character is replacedby the current user's name (without registry) when computing the remote filename.  This is only of interest to remote mail file users who share a commonLaurel.profile.New date syntax on outgoing messages:  The new format is  Wed, 9 Mar 83 16:32 PST   (Yeccchhhh).  This applies to the COM-T command as well.  The date at theupper right of the screen remains as old.INTERNAL CHANGESVM has replaced the Core for all File I/O.  The new interface Core, is a thinveneer over VM, and is similar to the now defunct CoreDefs.  One new module,CoreImpl, papers over this interface, providing the same old file name cache,which is now used only for enumerating recently accessed files in the bracketsfill-in code.The VirtualMgr now retains only a single page sized buffer for each object(displayed message, toc, and composed message).  TOC operations now requirelocks to operate properly in Cholla's multiprocessing environment.  SeeVirtualMgrDefs for details.  In essence, you must call LockTOC[tocHandle] toobtain a key (a CARDINAL) which must be passed to all other TOC manipulationprocedures.  Most often, a call to WaitForLock[tocHandle] is more appropriatethan a direct call to LockTOC, which may return 0, indicating that the tocHandlewas already locked.  When finished manipulating a toc, you should callUnlockTOC[tocHandle, key].Most operations level modules have been recoded to use CoreStreams rather thantheir own streaming procedures.A new interface, ccD: ChollaCmdDefs, glues together the Cholla part of Laurel. One procedure from this interface is used throughout Laurel proper; it isGetTOCForFile[fileName, tocClass], which returns a locked tocHandle with itskey.  This procedure manages a complicated toc cache for Cholla.  Laurel properwill use only "laurel" as the tocClass.  Passing a NIL filename to this procedureclears out that classes cache (see the Quit command for details.)  If this proceduregives you any trouble, see Will Crowther.ReplaceMailOp is very complicated.  It embodies most of the InsertMail code, butallows general insertion, deletion, or replacement of a single message in a mailfile, with corresponding changes in the TOC.  It is not actually used in Laurelproper, but is called from Insert.laurel.  Cholla uses it all over the place.The old module named ExpandOp is now named FileOp.  Expand in this moduleno longer understands @filename syntax.The new mail parser's interface is MailParseDefs (not MailParse), and itsimplementation is in the new module ArpaMailParser.  There are no longer anyBackup procedures supplied to this module's procedures.  The parser maintains aone character cache for those cases where it needs to look ahead one character. It will read the first character of the next header field or the CR of the linefollowing the last header field after reading a field body in GetFieldBody orParseNameList.  This is important when counting calls to the ReadChar procedureto locate field body boundaries in IntHardcopyCom and elsewhere.  The generalrule to follow is that everything works fine as long as you are streamingthrough the header, from field name to field body to field name to field body,etc.  If you must reset the ReadChar routine, you must FinalizeParse andInitializeParse to reset the cache correctly.  There is no performance penalty fordoing this, as the new parser does almost nothing during those calls.IF YOU WANT TO BUILD A NEW CHOLLA AND LAURELCommand files and file lists abound on the [Cherry]<Cholla>1Txx> directories. Source.Laurel, Source.LaurelDefs, Object.Laurel, and Object.LaurelDefs are filelists only--DO NOT USE THEM FOR COMPILATION.  Compile.LaurelDefs andCompile.Laurel are file lists containing the correct compilation order and leavingout those modules that should not be recompiled (e.g., LaurelExecDefs, whichMaintain and Chat depend on.)  To compile all of the Cholla impl's (andtherefore all of the Laurel impl's) say  Compile @Compile.laurel@to the executive.To bind and build an image using bootmesa, use the command files mc.cm andml.cm (for Make Cholla and Make Laurel).  Each one is to be invoked by saying  Bind @mcor  Bind @mlto the executive,The Laurel configuration is a subset of the Cholla configuration.  Laurel leavesmany Cholla interfaces unbound.  These procedures can never be called fromLaurel, so this is ok, but binding Laurel normally produces Binder warningmessages.  The ml.cm file ignores these warnings; the mc.cm file does not.  Thecorrect procedure when binding new versions is to bind a Cholla first, and if itsucceeds, then bind a Laurel.  The Cholla bind will detect any problems; if thereare none, then the Laurel binding warning may be ignored safely.Cholla will behave exactly as Laurel (displaying a Laurel herald, and no BBoardcommand) if the profile does not contain Cholla: TRUE.

This includesMaintain.laurel and Chat.laurel.MailFileScavenger.laurel depends on the Core interface, therefore, you will needthe new one.All of the runnable programs are stored on [Cherry]<Cholla>Laurel>, withversion numbers that correspond to the temporary version of Laurel 6.1 storedthere.  The sources for these programs are on [Cherry]<Cholla>1T35> (the 1T35being the current temporary version of Laurel and Cholla).Basic is stored on [Cherry]<Cholla>Basic>.  There is a 1T35 compatible Basic.laurelon [Cherry]<Cholla>Laurel>.  Basic has never received much use, and there aredefinitely some problems with it.  However, if you wish to continue to supportBasic, it should be reasonably simple to figure out what is going on by readingthe files stored on [Cherry]<Cholla>Basic>.The remaining runnable programs are pretty much the same ones that wereoffered for Laurel 6.  InsertMail.laurel is now called Insert.laurel.  There is also aReplace.laurel that behaves like Insert.laurel, except that it replaces the messageselected in the TOC.  Delete.laurel does an immediate delete of the messageselected in the TOC; it is not very useful for the general public and probablyshould not be announced.SearchMail.laurel works as before.  A new program, Extract.laurel behaves likeSearchMail, except that it copies the matching text into the composed message. With an imaginative search specification, this program can generate amazingreports and summaries.I declare that this message ties up the remaining loose ends.

There are some problems that arise when running on a 64K Alto: the Runcommand doesn't work at all due to running out of memory, and performance isgenerally poor.  We hope we can fix this by some tuning of various parameters(size of initial frame heap, free storage heap, and VM buffer storage).  We mayalso experiment with some packaging changes; e.g., reduce the number ofinterfaces exported from the top-level configuration to the minimum required, inorder to minimize the size of the LoadState.Assuming the non-Cholla part of Laurel is in a stable state, I would like to getcopies of all the files.  Doug led me to understand that you are keeping a Laureldevelopment disk (or disk image stored on Cherry).

We've concluded that something more than simple tuning is required.

At this time we are looking for people to test the new software for a fewweeks before the release.  This is intended to ensure that we have not overlookedany variations in machine configuration, environment, or style of use.Why a new Laurel?  After all, Laurel 6 has been around for about two yearsand has proven to be quite satisfactory for countless hundreds of users.  Thereare several reasons, the most important of which are:1. We have adopted the new ARPA header standard for all messages in theResearch Internet.  This is a considerable simplification over the old standard;and as part of this change we have taken the opportunity to clean up thetreatment of ARPA names within the mail system so as to better insulate us fromfuture changes in the ARPA standards.  The version of Hardy included inrelease 10 of the Mesa Development Environment already supports the newstandard; bringing Laurel into conformity will make the exchange of messagesbetween Laurel and Hardy users work more smoothly.2. There are several serious bugs in Laurel 6.  For example, there are certainmessages whose receipt will cause Laurel to crash.  And there is a problem thatmakes Laurel unusable on an Ethernet whose network number is greater than126 octal; this restriction has put a troublesome constraint on the configuration ofthe Research Internet.3. The departure of Doug Brotz, who was the principal person activelydeveloping Laurel for the past two years, gives us an opportunity to wrap up theLaurel project cleanly and permanently.  While we will attend to anycatastrophic problems that turn up, we are not planning any furtherdevelopment.Laurel 6.1 is functionally nearly identical to Laurel 6, though internally it isquite different.  There is also an expanded collection of programs that may beinvoked with Laurel's Run command.If you would like to be a Laurel 6.1 alpha tester, please answer this message (i.e.,send a message to LaurelSupport.PA).  We will send you more information andput your name on a special distribution list.  There will be no furtherannouncements sent to the entire Research Internet community until Laurel 6.1is officially released.	The Laurel Implementors	   Roy Levin <Levin.PA>	   Mike Schroeder <Schroeder.PA>	   Ed Taft <Taft.PA>	   John White <JWhite.PA>*start*00555 00024 US Date:  5-May-83 11:21:49 PDTFrom: willie-sue.paSubject: infrequent blank cc: fieldTo: Taftcc: willie-sueIf one has a message of the form:"Date: Thu, 5 May 83 09:35 PDTSender: Willie-Sue.PASubject: testing againTo: Willie-SueFrom: Me <willie-sue>xxxxx"And does an Answer, one gets:"Subject: Re: testing againIn-reply-to: "Your message of Thu, 5 May 83 09:35 PDT"To: Me <willie-sue>cc: xxx"Answer does duplicate name supression, but always puts out a cc: field.

If you try to Run a program that is not on your local disk, Laurel will usuallyattempt to retrieve a copy from a file server.  This is done under the control ofthe RunPath entry in your Laurel.profile; ordinarily this looks something like:	RunPath: [Ivy]<Laurel>This, of course, is the wrong place for obtaining Laurel programs when you arerunning the alpha-test version of Laurel.  You may get around this problem ineither of two ways.  (1) When you Run a program that is not on your local disk,you can type the complete remote file name into the Run brackets; e.g.,[Ivy]<Laurel>6.1T36>Chat.laurel.  (2) You can edit your Laurel.profile to changethe RunPath to something like:	RunPath: [Ivy]<Laurel>6.1T36>You will have to remember to undo this when Laurel 6.1 is officially released.2. Basic.laurel will not work properly on an Alto-II if the Mesa microcodeinstalled in the machine is too old.  (The symptom is that it fails to performarithmetic properly.)  In the next release, a test for correct microcode version willbe added.	The Laurel Implementors*start*01156 00024 US Date: Thu, 5 May 83 18:29 PDTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Laurel-runnable programsTo: LaurelAlphaTest^.PAReply-to: LaurelSupport.PAPlease remember that many of the new Laurel-runnable programs areunsupported.  The LaurelSupport group has no intention of doing any work onthem, even to fix bugs.  If Laurel breaks while you are running one of them,there is no point in reporting it.To date, Basic and Kal have proven particularly troublesome.  These programsdepend on the presence of microcode which is not available on all machines.  IfBasic or Kal breaks, it is almost assuredly because of a problem with incorrectmicrocode.If Basic does not work on an Alto-II XM, it is probably because obsolete ROM1Mesa microcode is installed; fixing this requires making a hardware change tothe Alto.  If Basic does not work on a Dolphin, it is probably because you don'thave the correct Alto/Mesa microcode installed on the disk; if you don't knowhow to install microcode, consult the person who helped set up your Dolphinoriginally.Kal does not work on 64K Altos or on Alto-IIs that don't have ROM1 Mesamicrocode installed.*start*00819 00024 US Date: Fri, 6 May 83 09:50 PDTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Re: Laurel 6.1 Mail File FormatIn-reply-to: "Putz's message of 5 May 1983 6:59 pm PDT (Thursday)"To: Putzcc: LaurelSupport, RobsonThe change to mail file format is as follows.  When Laurel displays a message forthe first time, it makes a decision about where to break lines.  Lines are alwaysbroken at spaces.  Laurel turns those spaces into "pseudo-CRs" with charactercode 240B, that is, space with the high-order bit turned on.  Thus, the originaltext can be recovered by ignoring the high-order bit of all characters; this iswhat Laurel does when copying text from a displayed message into thecomposition window or into a file.I'll have to let Mike Schroeder tell you what the TOC format is, as I knownothing about it.	Ed*start*00601 00024 US Date: Thu, 5 May 83 23:30 PDTFrom: Newman.esSubject: Error ReportTo: LaurelSupport.PAI was scrolling the bottom window while Chat was in the middle of painting intoit.Laurel 6.1T36  Alto II XM (035#014#) with 2K Rom XMcode using XM MDS: 00Banks: 140000 code: 000051Signal 056401 in IntExceptionsmsg 000001, msg^                            BackStop, 003377Signaller, 000521IntExceptions, 000223VirtCM, 000205VirtCom, 000207EditorDisplay, 001233EditorDisplay, 000566ExecStreamIO, 001444ExecStreamIO, 001063Chat, 003026Chat, 002214Stack end OurProcess*start*00529 00024 US Date: Tue, 10 May 83 00:14 EDTFrom: Ziobro.HenrSubject: Suggestion: Allow laurel "run" from command lineTo: laurelsupport.pa	It would be really nice if laurel allowed one to start a "run" commandfrom the command line.

A number of problemsdiscovered in the first release have been fixed (see the end of this message for asummary).  There is a new profile option, DisplayLines, of possible interest tousers of 64K Altos; see section 3.  A new Laurel runnable program, Groups, hasbeen introduced; see section 4.This message contains everything that Laurel 6 users should need to know inorder to run Laurel 6.1.  This documentation is being alpha tested as well as thesoftware itself; so please read carefully and report anything you discover that isincorrect, unclear, or missing.We are aiming for a formal release of Laurel 6.1 on approximately June 1, afterwhich we hope never to change Laurel again.  It is important, therefore, thatany remaining serious bugs be discovered and reported before that time.  Pleasebegin using Laurel 6.1T37 as soon as possible.1. Installing LaurelThis alpha test version of Laurel is called Laurel 6.1T37.  It has been stored indirectory <Laurel>6.1T37> on the following file servers:	Cactus, Erie, Ivy, Oly, Phylum, Rain, RoseBowlTo install the new Laurel, use FTP to retrieve the file <Laurel>6.1T37>Laurel.cmfrom one of the above servers.  Then Quit to the Executive and issue thecommand:	> @LaurelThis will obtain the new version of Laurel itself, as well as updated versions ofany Laurel-runnable programs already present on your disk.  When it isfinished, it will start Laurel.Dolphin users who also run Smalltalk-80 should note item 20 in section 5.2. Changes to message formatLaurel now supports the new ARPA header standard (RFC 822).  This means thatLaurel understands only those messages conforming to the standard, and willallow you to send only messages that conform.  Fortunately, the new format isnearly a subset of the old one, and is identical in most cases that matter.  Themain differences to pay attention to are as follows:-- All name-containing fields are now required to contain real mailbox names;formerly it was permissible for the From field to consist entirely of arbitrary textif a Sender field was present.  That is,	From: The Laurel Implementorsis no longer legal; an actual mailbox must be named, e.g.,	From: The Laurel Implementors <LaurelSupport.PA>It continues to be true that a Sender field must be present if the sender's namediffers from the mailbox named in the From field; Laurel will insert a Senderfield automatically when needed.-- The syntax for ARPA recipient names is generalized to "recipient@domain",where the domain is a hierarchical name whose root is usually "ARPA".  Forexample, "Joe.Blow@CMUA.ARPA" designates the recipient named Joe.Blow inthe CMUA sub-domain of the ARPA domain.  Currently this naming schememaps more-or-less directly onto the old "user@host" scheme; but it is evolving inthe direction of a more general hierarchical name structure that resembles (notaccidentally) the ones used in the Xerox Grapevine and Clearinghouse systems.One restriction you should be aware of is that the local-part of ARPA recipientnames (the part to the left of the "@") may not contain spaces or certain otherpunctuation characters unless they are quoted.  If Laurel complains about thesyntax of an ARPA recipient name, try putting quotes around the local-part; forexample:	To: "Joe Blow"@CMUA.ARPA-- The word " at " is no longer equivalent to "@" in ARPA recipient names.-- The new Laurel has no special knowledge of ARPA mailbox names except thatappearance of "@" in a name causes it to be treated as a member of the AGregistry (AG stands for "ARPA Gateway", but you never need to specify it). Furthermore, the ARPA host name PARC-MAXC is no longer treated specially. This is in order to decouple Laurel from any future changes to ARPA namesyntax or to the way in which the Xerox and ARPA internets are connected.This means that it's no longer necessary or even desirable to append"@PARC-MAXC" to Xerox R-Names in the headers of messages you send (evenin the From or Reply-to field).  Doing so may result in messages takingunnecessary hops through Maxc.A consequence of this change is that the Answer command may be confused byformerly legal headers that depended on ARPA name minimization algorithms,which have been eliminated.  For example, the header:	From: Brotz@PARC-MAXC	To: Foowill be answered as:	To: Brotz@PARC-MAXC	cc: Foo.AGsince the new parser understands that the sender was in the AG registry, andtherefore Foo must have been shorthand for Foo.AG.  Such cases should be rare,and will disappear altogether when everyone is using new versions of Laurel,Hardy, etc.-- The syntax for specifying a private distribution list -- "@FileName" -- hasbeen changed.  This was never part of the old ARPA standard, andunfortunately it conflicts with the syntax for specifying source routinginformation in the new standard.The new way to designate a private distribution list employs the ARPAstandard's "group" syntax.  Instead of writing:	To: @MyFriends.dlyou should write either:	To: MyFriends.dl: ; or:	To: MyFriends.dl: name1, name2, ... nameN;The first form leaves the members of the list unspecified in the header.  Whenyou send the message, Laurel will expand MyFriends.dl to obtain the names ofthe recipients (but won't modify the message header).The second form lists the individual members.  This list, of course, may be easilyfilled in by expanding the name of the list, using the COM-G command. Sending a message to recipients named in this way does not cause anydistribution list expansion, since the names are already listed in the header.If the name of the private distribution list contains special characters (brackets,commas, and a few others) then it must be quoted; e.g.,	To: "[Ivy]<MyName>MyFriends.dl": ;Note that this change applies only to PRIVATE distribution lists.  Public lists,e.g., MesaUsers^.pa, will continue to be treated as ordinary names.-- There are also changes in certain fields that are generated automatically byLaurel, e.g., Date and In-reply-to.  Laurel has been changed to conform to thenew standard.3. Other functional changes-- CR insertion in Deliver.  Laurel 6.1 no longer automatically inserts carriagereturns in messages being sent.  The only CRs present will be the ones you putin explicitly.  This enables messages to be properly formatted when displayed inwindows of various widths, which is important in view of the increasingdiversity of mail handling programs.Messages sent to ARPA recipients will have CRs inserted automatically as theypass through the Xerox-to-ARPA gateway on Maxc; this is necessary because anumber of ARPA mail programs are incapable of properly displaying messagescontaining arbitrary-length "lines".  If you are sure that the recipients will notobject, you may defeat the automatic CR insertion by including the field:	Line-fold: Nosomewhere in the header of the message.-- Blue button New mail.  Ordinarily, the "New mail" command retrieves allmessages pending in your in-box as a single, indivisible operation.  If there ismore mail in your in-box than will fit on your local disk (as sometimes occurs ifyou haven't run Laurel for a long time), then "New mail" will fail to retrieveany mail at all.  If you encounter this situation, click "New mail" with the blue(right) button.  This will retrieve messages and delete them from the in-box oneat a time until either your in-box is empty or your local disk is full, at whichpoint it will stop and let you process the messages received so far.  This methodof retrieving new mail is much slower than the normal method, so you shoulduse it only if you have to.  (Fine point: this works for in-boxes stored onGrapevine servers, but not ones on IFSs or Maxc.)-- Mail file format.  Laurel now inserts special characters into mail files toenable scrolling and display of messages to be performed substantially faster. This means that it is no longer reasonable to read mail files using Bravo or otherprograms.  The correct way to move messages into a file that other programs canread is to copy them into the composition window and then store them with thePut command.-- Operations on deleted messages.  The Hardcopy and Forward commands (butnot Move to) now operate on all selected messages without regard to whether ornot they have been deleted.-- Performance.  The internals of Laurel have been extensively reorganized,mainly to enable it to serve as the foundation for the Cholla process controlsystem.  Consequently, the performance of Laurel 6.1 is perceptibly differentfrom that of Laurel 6.  On machines with extended memory (most Alto-IIs and allDolphins and Dorados), Laurel 6.1's performance is generally better than Laurel6's.  But on machines with only 64K words of memory (all Alto-Is and certainearly Alto-IIs), performance is somewhat poorer.  We have recently expendedconsiderable effort making Laurel 6.1 run better on 64K machines, and webelieve it is usable even though not wonderful.A new Laurel.profile option, DisplayLines, has been introduced.  It determinesthe height of the display in text lines; the default value is "DisplayLines: 60". On a 64K Alto, decreasing this by even a few lines improves performancenoticeably, because decreasing the display area makes more memory available forother purposes and thereby reduces the amount of disk swapping activity.4. Changes to Laurel runnable programsThere have been some changes (mostly additions) to the programs you caninvoke with Laurel's Run command.  These programs are available from the samedirectory from which you obtained Laurel itself; all have the extension ".laurel".If you try to Run a program that is not on your local disk, Laurel will usuallyattempt to retrieve a copy from a file server.  This is done under the control ofthe RunPath entry in your Laurel.profile; ordinarily this looks something like:	RunPath: [Ivy]<Laurel>This, of course, is the wrong place for obtaining Laurel programs when you arerunning the alpha test version of Laurel.  You may get around this problem ineither of two ways.  (1) When you Run a program that is not on your local disk,you can type the complete remote file name into the Run brackets; e.g.,[Ivy]<Laurel>6.1T37>Chat.laurel.  (2) You can edit your Laurel.profile to changethe RunPath to something like:	RunPath: [Ivy]<Laurel>6.1T37>You will have to remember to undo this when Laurel 6.1 is officially released.The following programs are functionally the same as the ones for Laurel 6,though you will still need to obtain new versions for 6.1 (this is doneautomatically by the installation procedure in Laurel.cm).	Chat.laurel	Files.laurel	MailFileScavenger.laurel	Maintain.laurel	PupHacks.laurelThe program InsertMail.laurel has been renamed Insert.laurel, but is otherwisethe same.  The program Print.laurel has been withdrawn.The following programs are new.  This is the sole documentation.-- Extract.laurel behaves like SearchMail.laurel except that it copies the matchingtext into the composed message.  With an imaginative search specification, thisprogram can generate amazing reports and summaries.-- LineSort.laurel sorts a file full of text lines into order.  It requests an input fileand an output file.  It also asks whether to sort by "first words" or by "markers". First words means that the first word of each line is used as the sort key. Markers means that LineSort searches each line for a piece of text enclosed inbrackets (control-A and control-B, perhaps entered by means of COM-B), anduses that text as the sort key.  If a line does not contain brackets, the first wordis used.-- Replace.laurel is like Insert.laurel except that it replaces the message(s)currently selected in the table of contents rather than inserting after them.The following new programs are unsupported and are released on a "use at yourown risk" basis.  They have not been as carefully polished or as well tested asthe supported software.  Some of them may not work on 64K Altos.  Theseprograms are being made available in the hope that some people may find themuseful.  LaurelSupport is not maintaining them, so don't bother to report problemswith them.-- Basic.laurel is a fairly complete implementation of the Basic language.  Thereis no documentation other than the on-line help message (invoked by the Helpcommand); but if you are already familiar with Basic you should have nodifficulty using this one.Basic is too large to run on a 64K Alto.  If you find that Basic has trouble doingarithmetic, it's probably because floating point operations aren't being executedproperly by your machine.  On an Alto-II XM, this occurs if obsolete ROM1Mesa microcode is installed; fixing this requires making a hardware change tothe Alto.  On a Dolphin, this occurs if you don't have the correct Alto/Mesamicrocode installed on the disk; if you don't know how to install microcode,consult the person who helped set up your Dolphin originally.-- Flush.laurel retrieves and discards the contents of your in-box, leaving itempty.  This is useful primarily for administrators to clean up after users whonever read their mail.-- Groups.laurel performs set union, subtraction, intersection, and closureexpansion on both Grapevine groups and private distribution lists. Documentation may be found in file <Laurel>6.1T37>Groups.doc.  (This programwas recently contributed by Ron <Newman.es>.)-- Kal.laurel displays a pretty kaleidoscope pattern in the displayed messagewindow.  Kal does not work on 64K Altos.-- NameMatch.laurel searches the Grapevine data base (slowly!) for R-Namesmatching some pattern.-- SortMail.laurel prompts for an output file name (you must specify the ".mail"extension explicitly), and produces a version of Laurel's current mail file (theone named in the Mail file brackets) sorted by date.-- RemoteTTY.laurel enables you to access your Laurel from any terminal in theResearch Internet, including a home terminal dialled-in to a DLS.  To set upLaurel to be accessed remotely, simply run RemoteTTY; it will turn the screenblank except for a little picture of a telephone.  At this point you may connect toyour machine (by name or internet address) from the DLS or from any machinerunning Chat.When you connect, you are first required to type your password (terminated byESC).  You may now issue commands to a simple command interpreter (type "?"for a summary).  You have complete access to all the mail files on your disk; andyou may retrieve messages from your in-box and send new messages.The one thing that isn't entirely obvious is how to send messages.  At all timesthere exists a "composed message", just as in regular Laurel.  To modify it, youinvoke an editor with the "E" command.  This editor is quite different fromLaurel's, and is patterned after Tenex TECO; if you're not familiar with TECO,you'd better get advice from someone who is.  To leave the editor, type "EX"followed by ESC.  You may now use the "S" command to send the composedmessage (the same as Laurel's "Deliver" command).When you return to your machine and wish to regain local control, type yourpassword followed by ESC.  RemoteTTY will terminate and the regular Laureldisplay will reappear.-- LocalTTY.laurel is a "local" version of RemoteTTY.  It enables you to practicewith RemoteTTY's facilities without leaving your own machine.5. Disposition of bugs reported in Laurel 6.1T36  1. REJECTED.

Thank you very much.	The Laurel Implementors*start*04605 00024 US Date: Mon, 6 Jun 83 13:50 PDTSender: Taft.PAFrom: The Laurel Implementors <LaurelSupport.PA>Subject:  Laurel 6.1 is released To: AllMailUsers.dl: ;Reply-to: LaurelSupport.PAA new version of Laurel, version 6.1, has completed a month of alpha testing byapproximately 125 users, and is now available for general use.  Laurel 6.1entirely replaces Laurel 6.  If you use Laurel, we request that you convert toLaurel 6.1 at this time.Why a new Laurel?  After all, Laurel 6 has been around for about two yearsand has proven to be quite satisfactory for countless hundreds of users.  Thereare several reasons, the most important of which are:1. We have adopted the new ARPA header standard for all messages in theResearch Internet.  This is a considerable simplification over the old standard;and as part of this change we have taken the opportunity to clean up thetreatment of ARPA names within the mail system so as to better insulate us fromfuture changes in the ARPA standards.  The version of Hardy included inrelease 10 of the Mesa Development Environment already supports the newstandard; bringing Laurel into conformity will make the exchange of messagesbetween Laurel and Hardy users work more smoothly.2. There are several serious bugs in Laurel 6.  For example, there are certainmessages whose receipt will cause Laurel to crash.  And there is a problem thatmakes Laurel unusable on an Ethernet whose network number is greater than126 octal; this restriction has put a troublesome constraint on the configuration ofthe Research Internet.3. The departure of Doug Brotz, who was the principal person activelydeveloping Laurel for the past two years, gives us an opportunity to wrap up theLaurel project cleanly and permanently.  While we will attend to anycatastrophic problems that turn up, we are not planning any furtherdevelopment.Laurel 6.1 is functionally nearly identical to Laurel 6, though internally it isquite different.  There is also an expanded collection of programs that may beinvoked with Laurel's Run command.-- Installing Laurel --All the files needed to run Laurel are stored in the <Laurel> directory on thefollowing file servers:	Aztec, Cactus, Erie, Ice, Isis, Ivy, Jaws, Oly, Rain,	RoseBowl, Urchin, WaldenTo install the new Laurel, first make sure you have at least 120 free pages onyour disk (the new Laurel is larger than the old, and the installation procedurealso retrieves a Laurel 6.1 documentation file to your disk).  Use FTP to retrievethe file <Laurel>Laurel.cm from one of the above servers.  Then Quit to theExecutive and issue the command:	> @Laurel.cmThis will obtain the new version of Laurel itself, as well as updated versions ofany Laurel-runnable programs already present on your disk.  When it isfinished, it will start Laurel.  The current mail file will contain a series ofmessages documenting the changes in Laurel 6.1 (see below).Note to alpha testers: if you have been running one of the Laurel 6.1T3x testversions, you should convert to Laurel 6.1 at this time.  Thank you for yourhelp in shaking down the new software.Note to Cholla users: there will be a release of Cholla that corresponds to Laurel6.1, but it is not ready yet.  You should await a separate Cholla announcement.-- Documentation --For normal use, Laurel 6.1's user interface is nearly identical to Laurel 6's; soyou should have no difficulty getting started.  However, there are someimportant changes that you should be aware of, especially if you use privatedistribution lists or correspond with ARPA users.Complete documentation is stored in the mail file <Laurel>Laurel61.mail on anyof the above-mentioned file servers.  We suggest that you read thisdocumentation at your earliest convenience.  The installation procedure retrievesthis file to your disk and starts Laurel displaying it.  If you would like to havehardcopy, select all the messages in the table of contents and click the Hardcopycommand.  When you are finished with these messages, you may delete them.-- Reporting problems --If you encounter any problems with Laurel 6.1 or with the Laurel runnableprograms that are supported, please notify LaurelSupport.PA as usual.  Youshould mention that you are running Laurel 6.1; we will no longer respond toreports about Laurel 6.  Bug reports generated automatically by Laurel containthis version information already.	The Laurel Implementors	   Roy Levin <Levin.PA>	   Mike Schroeder <Schroeder.PA>	   Ed Taft <Taft.PA>	   John White <JWhite.PA>*start*00829 00024 US Date: Tue, 7 Jun 83 10:19 PDTFrom: McBain.esSubject: Error ReportTo: LaurelSupport.PAI was running LocalTTy, went into the E(dit) function and then typed <someletter> <ESC>.

This is information of interest to a large number of Laurel users, butwe have no way of identifying who they are.This is an elaboration on the "Performance" section of the "Other functionalchanges" message in the Laurel 6.1 documentation.  Laurel 6.1 is much moresensitive than Laurel 6 to the amount of memory present in the machine it isrunning on.  The performance of Laurel 6.1 on a 64K Alto (any Alto-I or certainearly Alto-IIs) is not as good as Laurel 6's.  We are sorry, but there is nopractical way of improving this state of affairs; 64K words are just not quiteenough for a program of Laurel's size and complexity.  If you have a 64K Altoand you are dissatisfied with the performance of Laurel 6.1, you shouldexperiment with changing the DisplayLines parameter, as described in thedocumentation.A number of users have reported that Laurel 6.1 is significantly slower thanLaurel 6 even when running on Alto-IIs that are believed to have extendedmemory (more than 64K).  This is almost certainly due to the way in which theAlto is configured; and there IS something you can do about it.In order for Laurel (and other Mesa programs) to take advantage of extendedmemory, not only must there actually be more than 64K of memory, but also thecorrect "extended memory Mesa microcode" must be installed in the machine'ssecond bank of microinstruction PROMs.  (Or the machine must have a 3K RAMboard; but there aren't very many of those.)In order to determine your machine's configuration, you should use Laurel's Runcommand to invoke the program What.laurel, which was included as part of theLaurel release.  It will display something like this:  memConfig = [AltoType: AltoIIXM, xmMicroCode: FALSE, useXM: FALSE,  controlStore: Ram0, banks: 100000B, mesaMicrocodeVersion: 41];  disC.bitmapInMDS = TRUE; dsD.machineFlavor = alto;If AltoType is AltoIIXM then your machine has extended memory.  However, ifxmMicroCode is FALSE then the extended memory Mesa microcode is notinstalled and Laurel cannot take advantage of the extended memory.If your Alto is configured like this, you should ask your hardware support staffto install Mesa6 PROMs (or XMesa5 PROMs) in the ROM1 positions on yourAlto's control board, and to exchange the SW1K and SW2K PROMs so that SW2Kis in position 51.  When this is done correctly, What.laurel will report:  memConfig = [AltoType: AltoIIXM, xmMicroCode: TRUE, useXM: TRUE,  controlStore: RamandRom, banks: 140000B, mesaMicrocodeVersion: 41];  disC.bitmapInMDS = FALSE; dsD.machineFlavor = alto;(The "banks" and "mesaMicrocodeVersion" may be different than given here, butthe others will be exactly as shown.)By doing this, you will be rewarded with very substantially improvedperformance when running Laurel (and other Mesa programs).  Nearlyeverything will work faster, and the incidence of dropped keystrokes will bereduced or eliminated.*start*00850 00024 US Date: Wed, 8 Jun 83 10:37 PDTFrom: SStrasen.esSubject: Problem ReportTo: LaurelSupport.PAcc: McBain, SStrasenI have encountered a "System error.

What should really happen isthat Laurel should index each message before checkpointing it to the mail fileand deleting the message from the inbox.  In fact what happens is that messagesget retrieved until the disk is full and then the indexing is done.  The indexingsucceeds only if the table of contents will fit in the disk space made available bydeleting the message that was being retrieved when the disk overflowed.It's not possible to predict when disk space will be exhausted, since the pagecount in the disk descriptor is only a hint.  The algorithm outlined above is theonly one I can think of that would work.  I probably would have changed thecode to use that algorithm if I had seen how it's currently being done.

Just now, for example,I deleted a message around position 250 in a 400-odd message Active mail file,and Laurel rattled the disk for a good minute and a half while Quitting.  Fromthe sound of things, I suspect Laurel is (a) copying a large part of the messagefile to a scratch file before copying it back over itself, and (b) copying only onepage at a time.2) During typein, both in message composition and in Laurel Chat, there arefrequent hesitations of anywhere from half a second to over 5 seconds whentypein does not echo and the cursor does not blink.  The characters are beingbuffered, all right, but the frequent pauses are annoying and did not occur inLaurel 5.  I have no theory about this -- it happens much too often to be causedby writing a new page on the scratch file, which produces an audible disk seekin any case (the abovementioned hesitations are silent).Can you shed any light on these phenomena?  I have an Alto II with 128K.*start*01425 00024 US Date: Tue, 5 Jul 83 14:19 PDTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Re: Laurel 6.1 performance problemsIn-reply-to: "Deutsch's message of Tue, 5 Jul 83 12:00 PDT"To: Deutschcc: LaurelSupportIt sounds as if you have one of those Alto-IIs with extended memory but lackingthe XMesa PROMs, so Laurel is behaving as if it were running on a 64Kmachine.1) Deleting a message in the middle of a large mail file has always taken a longtime, though it is perhaps possible that it takes longer with Laurel 6.1 than itwould have taken with Laurel 6.  Removing deleted messages is done byin-place compression.  It is done in a fairly simpleminded way, but theread-ahead and write-behind provided by the Mesa VM package is supposed totake care of making bulk transfers of this sort efficient.  However, the VMmechanisms are subverted if there isn't enough memory, as is true on a 64Kmachine.2) The Laurel 6.1 editor has a bigger working set than the one in Laurel 6. When you hear the disk seeking a lot during editing, I believe it is due to codethrashing.I have received several reports of Laurel 6.1 "freezing" for varying lengths oftime.  Yours is the first from anyone not on net 3.  I have been assuming untilnow that the freezes are caused by some sort of bad Ethernet traffic on net 3(e.g., uncontrolled broadcasts).  I have not yet been able to gather sufficientevidence of this, however.	Ed*start*00507 00024 US Date: Tue, 5 Jul 83 17:48 PDTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Error in Answer formTo: LaurelSupportIf there is ever a Laurel 6.2, the following should be fixed.

This minimized the frequency of seeking back and forth between the read andwrite positions in the mail file.In Laurel 6.1 this was ripped out and replaced by a simpleminded scheme basedon ordinary Laurel streams, which are built on top of the Alto/Mesa VMpackage.  There is some amount of read-ahead and write-behind, but I don'tbelieve it extends over more than 3 or 4 pages at a time.I believe this explains the difference in performance when deleting a messagefrom the middle of a big mail file.  I don't know why the change was made; butit's too late to do anything about it now.	Ed*start*00636 00024 US Date: Thu, 7 Jul 83 14:10 EDTFrom: Dusel.WBSTSubject: Error ReportTo: LaurelSupport.PAI clicked new mail blue after my disk overflowed with a normal mail retrieval.

Ibelieve all the error reports were for Laurel 6, so perhaps Laurel 6.1 does nothave this problem.However, the bad message was sent by a Laurel 6.1 user.  The problem with theheader was that the extra CR at the end was missing.  The first several lines ofthe body happened to begin with spaces and/or tabs, so they appeared to becontinuations of the last line of the header, which was a Reply-to field.This made the Reply-to field syntactically incorrect.  The header parser knows itis incorrect, since attempting to answer it yields a syntax error.  However, forsome reason Laurel failed to detect this during Deliver; and thus it permitted thisbad header to escape.I suspect the header parser is being called by Deliver only to extract theinformation required for delivery (To and cc); and since the Reply-to field isn'trequired for delivery, it isn't getting parsed.  This is incorrect.  Deliver shouldparse every field, even if it uses only some of the information.*start*01026 00024 US Date: Thu, 14 Jul 83 17:49 PDTFrom: Freige.PASubject: Error ReportTo: LaurelSupport.PAI had just composed a "new form" message to Bob Ritchie, invoked "Deliver" andwas then prompted to send this message.

During this time the cursor moves with the mouse, but it does notrespond to button clicks, the arrow does not change form/direction, and anything you type does not come out, but it does queue it up so it jumpsout all at once.  This all happens often enough that when workingthrough a large pile of mail, it is not at all uncommon to have it happen many times such that you cannot just whip around with the mouse clicking and pushing keys because things are missed.  It does it evenon real simple things, like moving the cursor back a few characterswith the mouse and left button, or scrolling up the middle window a smallamount (I know this might need the disk, but not for 10-15 seconds! - ifit does not ignore you, it may put the bigger arrow up for the 10-15 seconds,or the arrow may stay at the 'wrong angle' as you move it all over)or bugging the display or delete button - you might have to click itfor 5 seconds or more continually to get it's attention.  All this israndom.  It works instantaneously and normally most of the time.One person here reported it stopping for minutes, and the mouse notmoving the cursor during that time, although this seems to be anisolated incident.I do not remember such problems when 6.1 first came out.  I do have 128K with XM etc... I keep running "what" to see if perhapssomething is loose and it went away, but it is there.  Also, it happenson two altos, although it seems (hard to tell) on one slightly more than the other.  The one it seems to do more on has mesa5, the other mesa 6.Question(s):	Have you seen this or am I alone?	Any ideas on what causes it? 	Is there any hope/help?As always, thanx for your help.				--Ray Clark*start*00838 00024 US Date: Fri, 29 Jul 83 16:32 PDTFrom: BRay.ESSubject: Error ReportTo: LaurelSupport.PAI WAS TRYING TO RETRIEVE MY MAIL AND RAN OUT OF SPACE.

That is, if you print a message that was sent by Laurel 6 (whichbreaks lines while sending) then the lines are broken; but if you print a messagethat was sent by Laurel 6.1 (or Hardy or Walnut or any mail system besidesLaurel 6, none of which break lines while sending) then the lines aren'tbroken.  It does not make any difference whether you used Laurel 6 or Laurel6.1 to RECEIVE the message.To verify this, try printing this message, which of course was sent with Laurel6.1.However, Laurel 6.1 does insert "pseudo-CRs" in received mail for its own use indisplaying messages efficiently.  These pseudo-CRs are characters with code240C, and they always replace spaces (40C).  Most programs ignore thehigh-order bit of each character and see just spaces where Laurel 6.1 putspseudo-CRs.  If you are in a position to change the program you are using toprint your mail files, you should have it treat pseudo-CRs (code 240C) the sameas regular CRs (15C).  This, by the way, works only for mail files RECEIVED byLaurel 6.1.	Ed Taft*start*02043 00024 US Date: Wed, 31 Aug 83 10:04 PDTSender: Taft.PAFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: Re: "Ethernet Information"In-reply-to: "shinbrot.wbst's message of 31-Aug-83  9:13:39 EDT"To: shinbrot.wbstcc: EthernetInterest^.dlos, LaurelSupport.PAReply-To: LaurelSupport.PAFirst of all, EthernetInterest^.dlos was not the right list to send your question to. That list is for messages having to do with the Ethernet hardware, protocols, andproducts; whereas you are asking a question about mail systems.Second, when you have basic procedural questions such as this, I suggest youconsult some experienced local user for advice rather than broadcasting questionsto a distribution list.  If you don't know whom to start with, I would suggest theperson who registered you as a Laurel user.To briefly answer your specific questions:  a) You get on the list.  b) There is no automatic compilation or archiving of messages to interestgroups; and there is no analog to the "bulletin board" facilities available in somesystems.  However, for some groups, people have collected the messages andstored them in a public place.  I would suggest asking the owner of the groupsin question, who can be reached by sending a message to Owner-X where X isthe name of the group.  c) Xerox users are not ordinarily permitted to "get onto" the Arpanet in thesense of being able to initiate terminal connections or transfer files to and fromother Arpanet sites.  Only people engaged in activities sponsored by ARPA orother government agencies are supposed to have such access.  However, you cancorrespond with Arpanet users (and other people reachable via the ARPAInternet) by electronic mail, so long as you are careful not to carry on Xeroxbusiness or to send messages that could be construed as promoting a Xeroxproduct.  There is information about corresponding with Arpanet users in theLaurel manual, and more information in the Laurel tutorial mail files(Tutorial.mail and Laurel61.mail).	Ed Taft (for LaurelSupport)*start*00652 00024 US Date: Thu, 1 Sep 83 16:25 EDTFrom: Hengst.WBSTSubject: Error ReportTo: LaurelSupport.PAMoving window boundaries back to their normal position.Laurel 6.1  Dolphin (124#165#) with XMcode using XM MDS: 00 Banks: 177760Signal 056401 in IntExceptionsmsg 000001, msg^                            BackStop, 003405Signaller, 000521IntExceptions, 000223VirtTOC, 001342VirtTOC, 001446VirtTOC, 000652IntTOC, 000634IntTOC, 000357IntBoundaryCom, 003377IntBoundaryCom, 002230IntBoundaryCom, 001212IntBoundaryCom, 000314IntTrackMain, 002617IntTrackMain, 001111IntTrackMain, 000703LaurelNub, 000126DebugNub, 000333*start*00691 00024 US Date: Tue, 6 Sep 83 18:39 EDTFrom: JordanHD.WbstSubject: Error ReportTo: LaurelSupport.PAcc: JordanHD.WbstThe last command I invoked was DISPLAY.The document appeared and I was reading it when Laurel crashed.HarleyLaurel 6.1  Alto II XM (123#035#) with 3K Ram XMcode using XM MDS: 00Banks: 170000 code: 000051Signal 000201 in Residentmsg 000001, msg^                            BackStop, 003405Signaller, 000521Resident, 001407Resident, 001427Keyboard, 000657IntTrackMain, 000174IntTrackEdit, 000304IntTrackMain, 001112IntTrackMain, 000704LaurelNub, 000126DebugNub, 000334------------------------------------------------------------*start*00676 00024 US Date: Mon, 12 Sep 83 13:37 EDTFrom: Oszczakiewicz.HenrSubject: Error ReportTo: LaurelSupport.PAAttempt to "Quit" after reading the current mail showed the "oops".Laurel 6.1  Alto II XM (002#120#) with Ram only MDS: 00 Banks: 100000 code:000051Signal 056401 in IntExceptionsmsg 000001, msg^                            BackStop, 003405Signaller, 000521IntExceptions, 000223CoreStreams, 002561CoreStreams, 001663MailFileOp, 002614ChollaCmdStub, 001462ChollaCmdStub, 000741ChollaCmdStub, 000106IntMailCom, 000470IntTrackMain, 001725IntTrackMain, 001252IntTrackMain, 001112IntTrackMain, 000704LaurelNub, 000126DebugNub, 000334*start*01087 00024 US Date: Fri, 23 Sep 83 15:08:53 PDTFrom: FilletSupport.paSubject: Re: Mail File FormatTo: Karltoncc: MessageSystemImplementors^, FilletSupport, ZdybelSender: Putz.paReply-To: FilletSupport.paIn-Reply-To: "Karlton.PA's message of Fri, 16 Sep 83 9:30:53 PDT"Thank you for telling us about the complete mail file syntax.

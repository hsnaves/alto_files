(However, overlapping the bitmap is not a disaster, since  -- everything here is unlocked before the bitmap is allocated.  Getting  -- this wrong may slow startup, but should not cause anything to break.)  QueueCool, PupRouterCool, AMCUCool, TedIn, QueueIn, PupRouterIn,  PupChecksums, DispatcherHot, TedOut, QueueOut, PupSockets, PupRouterOut,  BFS, DiskKD, Files, FSP, Miscellaneous, Modules, NonResident, OurProcess,  SegmentsB, SegmentsA, StringsA, StringsB, LaurelNub, IntRefreshers,  NameConversion, intCommon, displayCommon, Display,  IntBoundaryCom, KeyStreams, DMSTime,  DiskRequestor, AltoFileOpsA, VMCacheOps, VMCacheMgr, VMIO, VMPageOps,  VMPageMgr, VMStorageMgr, DynamicZoneHot,  -- These are handled the same as the previous group.  They are things  -- not executed until after the bitmap is allocated, but which  -- we would like to have brought in initially and moved to hyperspace  -- by the Swapper before Laurel gets control (this expedites startup).  -- On a non-XM machine these most certainly get displaced by the bitmap  -- before anyone has a chance to execute them.  SetTime, TimeConvert, RetrieveInit, RetrievePoll, Protocol,  IntMBXState, NameInfo, Locate, VirtCM, VirtCom,  AltoFileOpsB, AltoFileOpsC, AltoKD, AltoDirectory, VMFile;SWAPPEDINCODE:  -- These are initially swapped in for the purpose of being executed  -- before the bitmap is created, and are almost certainly displaced  -- by the bitmap.  VirtSS, LoadState, Directory, HyperRegion, MesaInit,  StreamsA, StreamsB, StreamsC, Faults, DebugNub, Wart, Boss, InitLaurel,  IntExceptions, PupErrors, DummyForwarder, TedCold, QueueCold,  PupRouterCold, DispatcherCold, AMCUCold, LaurelSegments, EditorDisplay,  DiskControl, VMControl, VMFile, DynamicZoneCold;NOTRAP: Resident, LaurelInterrupt, DiskIO, Swapper, MDSRegion, HyperRegion,  Signaller, OurProcess, NonResident, SegmentsA, SegmentsB, MesaInit, Files,  Wart, Modules, Miscellaneous, Faults, LaurelFont;-- The GFT consists of 2-word entries and occupies an integral number of-- pages (2 here).GFT: 256;-- PSBs occupy 5 words each.

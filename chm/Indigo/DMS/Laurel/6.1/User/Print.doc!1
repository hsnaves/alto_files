[IVY]<Pier>LaurelPrint.doc				14 Aug. 1981Print is a program to generate Press format filesand send them to your local printer.  It is handy for generatingcode listings since it will print files in 2 column landscape mode.[IVY]<Pier>Print.laurel is a version of this program that will runin the Laurel composition window.Command format:Activate Print with the Laurel Run button. Type a command line terminatedby ESC. "<filename1> <filename2> <filename3>"  just prints the specifiedfiles on the printer specified in the HARDCOPY section of your User.cm."<filename>" may be a full path name, such as [IVY]<Pier>Print>LaurelPrint.doc. For remote files, the FTP protocol is used to copy the remote file to PRINT.TEMP$ on your local disk, press it, and delete it. Multiple files are batched to be sent to the printer as long as the fonts are the same.  If a file is already in Press format it will be sent directly to the printer. Typing DEL and being patient will abort in midstream."Print /b ..."  Shifts to Bravo mode.  (There is no way to get outof it.)  This processes only a subset of Bravo formatting (tabs, fonts and faces).It uses the fonts specified in the BRAVO section of your User.cm.Switches:/a		Print headers on each page (default true; -a disables)./z		Print trailers on each page (default true; -z disables).<host>/h	Directs the output to <host>.<output>/o	Creates a press file in <output> (defaulting .press).		Disables transmission to printer.<font>/f	Changes the font to <font> for the following files.  The		default is Gacha8 in portrait; Gacha6 in landscape./c<n>		Sets number of copies to <n> (default 1)./t<n>		Changes the tab stops to <n> spaces (default 8)./l<n>		Landscape mode.  <n> is the number of columns (default 2)./p<n>		Portrait mode.  <n> is the number of columns (default 1)./s<n>		Number of sides.  <n> IN[0..2]; 0=> use printer default./m  		Messages. /-m or /~m turns off "progress" messages in the                Laurel window. This is useful when large numbers of files                are being Pressed.The switches that don't need a string as an argument will also work inlocal mode.  Local switches appearing after the argument is "used up"are global.  Defaults are:  Gacha6/fl2s2c1azt8mExamples:	 Foo	 Foo/l	 /l Foo1 Foo2	 /c3 Foo1 Foo2/l3 TimesRoman10BI/f Foo3/l	 Foo1/p2 Foo2/b         /-m Foo1 Foo2 Foo3 Foo4 Foo5 Foo6 Foo7 /m Foo8Richard Johnsson wrote the front end, Bob Ayers wrote the Bravo formatterand Hal Murray wrote the Presser. Ken Pier modified the program for theLaurel environment.KAP, 11 Aug. 1981 12:39 pm PDT

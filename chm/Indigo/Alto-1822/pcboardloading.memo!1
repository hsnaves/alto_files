Do not load the capacitor located between board locations D-5 and D-6.  There is a paste-up error theree which would connect the capacitor to a signal line.l4256d2999x3e24jk402.		Wire C-7 pin 2 to C-8 pins 1 and 2.Wire C-8 pin 3 to Alto backplane pin 117.(These changes are for the TASKB' output signal.)l4256d2999x3e24jk403.		Mill back Alto end board corners per Alto-II board standard.l4256d2999x3e24jk404.		Enlarge mounting holes for the 27 ohm resistor near the free edge connector.  The holes will not accomodate a half watt resistor.l4256d2999x3e24jk405.		The original component drawing shows the two diodes installed backwards.  The correct installation should have the diodes pointing away from the ground trace and towards the +5 trace.l4256d2999x3e24jk40\135i4I27i7I6.		Location C-9 is the 'Control' PROM.Location D-8 is the 'Output' PROM.Location E-1 is the 'Input' PROM.l4256d2999x3e24jk40e12jk40

However, to install an Alto-1822 there, a few wires need to be added.  If any of the J18 pins mentioned already have wires, stop and find out why!e12jk40Alto Signal Name	From	To	1822 Signal NameAUSYSCLK	J14-72	J18-72	AuSysClk5ACT*	J11-102	J18-118	ITAc'TASKB*	J10-14	J18-117	TASKB'WAKE5*	J11-60	J18-112	WakeIT'x3e12jk40(0,7456)(1,9696)(2,12320)\u42UAlto Ie12jk40(635)\bA standard Alto I has much less standard wiring.  To install an Alto-1822 in slot 2, the following wires (at least) need to be added.e12jk40Alto Signal Name	From	To	1822 Signal NameAUSYSCLK	J7-72	J2-72	AuSysClk-TASKB	J6-14	J2-117	TASKB'-5ACT	J7-102	J2-118	ITAc'-WAKE5	J7-60	J2-112	WakeIT'OKTORUN	J2-1	J2-11	OKToRun-SIO	J3-41	J2-41	SIO'x3e12jk40(0,7456)\u42UIn addition to the signals mentioned above, the following signals must be present at whatever slot you use:BUS[00]-[15]DBARCF1[0]-[3]F2[0]-[3]NEXT[6]-[7]OKTORUNRESETe24jk40(635)Cablinge12jk40\bThe Alto-1822 internal cable is a 40 conductor ribbon cable with a 40 pin PC Card edge connector at the board end and a DB-37S connector at the Alto rear connector panel.  Install it in the obvious way!e12jk40An Alto-1822 external cable is somewhat more complicated.  Depending on the situation, it should be either a 'Local-Host' cable or a 'Distant-Host' cable.  The former are for runs of up to about 30 feet, the latter for runs up to about 1000 feet.  Refer to 'AICables.memo' and BBN-1822 for additional information.e12jk40

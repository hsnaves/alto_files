*start*01905 00024 US Date: 3 Jul 1980 4:48 pm PDT (Thursday)From: CaywoodTo: CaywoodSubject: Lesson 1cc: Welcome to Laurel.   Since you are reading this message, you have alreadylearned to use the "Display" command.  So far, so good.  Notice that you can't seethe end of this message.  Solution?  Simple.  Scroll the message as you wouldscroll using the EDITOR by moving the cursor into the left margin until itbecomes the double headed arrow cursor and press the LEFT mouse button toscroll up.  As in the EDITOR, use the RIGHT mouse button to scroll down. What is Laurel?  Laurel is a message system that is part of the Xerox DocumentSystem.  You can receive, display, forward, classify, file and print messages fromother users as well as compose and transmit messages and replies.  Your mail filesreside on your local disk.In Laurel, there are four separate areas on the display screen.   From top tobottom, they are:	*  the table of contents window	*  the message display window	*  the composition and delivery window, and	*  the feedback windowIn the Table-of-Contents window you will see an index of all messages in yourmail file.  Each entry is numbered and shows the date the message was sent. This index can be scrolled just as you scrolled this message.  The triangularsymbol at the left of an entry in the table of contents is an indication of thecurrently selected message.  Messages that have not been examined will have a"?" next to them.  Above the table of contents window is a menu, with commands in bold.  Youhave already learned about User and New Mail.  Mail File and Quit will bediscussed in another lesson.For now, move the cursor into the left margin of the table of contents and selectmessage number 2 (point at the message and press the LEFT mouse button). Now mark the command "Display" that is in bold above the message displaywindow.*start*01166 00024 US Date: 3 Jul 1980 5:02 pm PDT (Thursday)From: CaywoodTo: CaywoodSubject: Lesson 2cc: Above this message display window is a menu of commands in bold.  You havealready learned one of the commands (Display).  Let's skip over Hardcopy fornow and learn about Delete and Undelete.  Suppose you have read a message anddecide you don't need to keep it for future reference.To practice, select the first message in your table of contents, come down to themenu where Delete appears.  Point the cursor at Delete and press the LEFTmouse button.  See the line drawn through the message entry?  This indicatesthe message has been selected for deletion.  When you finish your Laurelsession, the message will be deleted permanently.What if you have selected a message for deletion and decide, before finishingyour Laurel session, that you really DON'T want that message deleted?  Selectthe message once again in the table of contents window.  Point the cursor atUndelete and press the LEFT mouse button.  Undelete the first message now.Select Lesson 3 in your table of contents and mark Display to learn about MoveTo and Mail file.  *start*02425 00024 US Date: 3 Jul 1980 5:36 pm PDT (Thursday)From: CaywoodTo: CaywoodSubject: Lesson 3cc: You can "batch" messages in Laurel with the Move To and Mail File commands. For example, all of the messages you have been reading about how to use Laurelmight be placed in a file called HELP that you can return to when needed.  Asan exercise let's move this message into another file called HELP.To Move a message, it must first be selected in the table of contents.  Since thismessage is already selected, mark Move to in the menu above the messagedisplay window.  The blinking caret should now be in the brackets followingMove To.  If it's not, retrace your steps and try again.  Type the word HELP andpress the DO key.  In the feedback window (bottom-most window on your display) the message"New file" will appear, along with a request for a confirmation.  Confirm bypressing the DO key.  Pressing CANCEL would cancel the Move to command.Notice that in the table of contents window the message you moved is nowshown with a line through it, and the letter "m" is next to it (where the questionmark had been).  This indicates that the message has been moved to another file,and is marked for deletion in the ACTIVE mail file . You can still keep themessage in your ACTIVE file by marking Undelete.  Mark Undelete now to keepthe message in your Active fileNow you have two mail files on your disk.  One is ACTIVE and one is HELP. To read the HELP mail file, read all the instructions in this paragraph, since thecurrently displayed message (containing the lesson) will disappear.  Point thecursor at Mail File in the Upper Menu and press the LEFT mouse button.  Theblinking caret has moved inside the brackets.  Type HELP and press the DOkey.  In the HELP mail file, display the message, Lesson 3, and scroll to continuethe lesson.  You should now be reading the message you moved to the mail file calledHELP.  You can delete, undelete and do any of the things to the HELP file thatyou do to your ACTIVE mail file.  It is wise to always return to your ACTIVEmail file prior to marking New Mail.  When you mark NEW MAIL your messageswill be deposited into the mail file that is currently shown in the bracketsfollowing Mail file.To get back to your ACTIVE mail file mark Mail File, type ACTIVE and pressthe DO key.   After returning to ACTIVE mail, continue to Lesson 4. *start*00687 00024 US Date: 3 Jul 1980 5:42 pm PDT (Thursday)From: CaywoodTo: CaywoodSubject: Lesson 4cc: You have returned to Active mail.Reading some of these messages may have been uncomfortable because of thesmall size of the message display window.  To remedy this problem you maychange the size of the windows.To move the window boundary press and hold down the MIDDLE mouse buttonwhile moving the cursor over to the small box on the right of the boundary youwish to change.  Slowly, move the box either up or down and notice how thebox follows.When you are satisfied with the position of the new boundary, release the mousebutton.Mark Display to continue. *start*01183 00024 US Date: 3 Jul 1980 6:08 pm PDT (Thursday)From: CaywoodTo: CaywoodSubject: Lesson 5cc: Did you notice you didn't have to select the message in the table of contentswindow before marking Display?  If you continue to mark Display, messages willbe displayed in the order they appear in the table of contents.  You don't need toindividually select a message, unless you wish to view it out of sequence.In earlier lessons, you saw the question mark disappear when you display amessage.  After moving a message the letter "m" appeared next to the message. The "m" and the question mark are called "Mark Characters".  You can provide amark character to any message.  Why?  You can mark messages you may want togo back and answer at some later time, or messages that are most important.To insert or change the mark character, move the cursor to the left of themessage number and press the LEFT mouse button.  A black box will appearuntil you release the button.  The box is replaced by the blinking caret.  Youcan type any character.  To delete a mark character, follow the same steps anduse a space as the mark character. Mark Display to go on.*start*01302 00024 US Date: 3 Jul 1980 6:43 pm PDT (Thursday)From: CaywoodTo: CaywoodSubject: Lesson 6cc: You have already used the scrolling feature, and may have noticed that youcannot use the MIDDLE button to "Thumb" as you do in the EDITOR. Thumbing in Laurel is different than in the EDITOR.Notice that below each of the three menus is a horizontal line which appearspartially as a dashed line.  This is the thumbing bar in Laurel.  To "Thumb" amessage, position the cursor just below this bar, press and hold the MIDDLEmouse button to change the cursor to a short vertical line on the bar.  Movingthe mouse to the left or right causes a corresponding movement of this line.Moving the vertical line to the extreme right edge of the bar identifies the endof the text; moving it to the extreme left identifies the beginning, andpositioning it in the center of the bar specifies the middle of the text.When you release the MIDDLE mouse button the position of the text identifiedby the vertical line is brought to the top of the window.  As in the EDITOR, textis positioned relative to the position of the cursor.Before covering the last menu and window you may want to review what youhave learned and take a break.When you're ready, mark Display to see the next lesson.*start*05514 00024 US Date: 3 Jul 1980 8:41 pm PDT (Thursday)From: CaywoodTo: CaywoodSubject: Lesson 7cc: This lesson will show you how to compose and send messages with Laurel, usingthe compositon and delivery window.  This window is headed by its own menuwith the commands New Form, Answer, Forward, Get, and Put.Position the cursor under New form and press the LEFT mouse button.  Amessage format is displayed, that requires you to supply some information beforethe message can be sent.  Before you attempt to provide this information, read onabout how to edit text in Laurel.Laurel observes some of the same type-in conventions that you have learned inthe EDITOR.  It displays a blinking caret for inserting text, which can bepositioned as in the EDITOR.  The Quick Command COM-I positions the caret atthe beginning of a word or letter, and the Quick Command COM-A positions thecaret following a word or letter.  You can erase a character with the BS key, andan entire word by using the Quick Command COM-BS as you do in the EDITOR.To delete text, select it with the mouse and press the DEL key.  Laurel does not recognize character or paragraph format "looks", such as italics,bold-face, multiple fonts, or justify, nesting, etc.  Laurel does supply automaticline breaks as the EDITOR does, so you need not press RETURN except toseparate paragraphs with white space.Laurel identifies fields that it expects you to replace by supplying a keywordbracketed by black rectangles, e.g., Recipients.   To replace one of these fields,select it with the MIDDLE mouse button and press the DEL key.  Fill in theform by replacing the fields with requested information.  Try deleting andadding information to the message field.  Notice that as you replaced the firstfield, the word Deliver appeared at the right of the menu.When composing a message always fill in the "To" field and the "Subject" field. Laurel automatically fills in your name on the "cc" line, assuming you will wanta copy of the message you are composing.  You may delete the "cc" line if it isnot needed.   Be careful not to delete the one blank line provided by Laurelfollowing the "cc" line.  When the message is delivered, Laurel will supply  aDate and From field automatically, filling in the date and time, and the username from the User bracket in the top menu.If you forget to edit one of the bracketed fields Laurel will refuse to send yourmessage, thus protecting you from simple oversights, such as forgetting to supplya "Subject".When you send a message, it must be to an authenticated user.  Laurel usersmust have IFS mail user accounts to be authenticated.  Laurel searches the IFS tochek the validity of recipients before delivering a message.  You became anauthenticated user when you supplied your name and password at the beginningof your Laurel session.The next command in the menu is Answer.  Mark Answer.  Since you havedone some editing to the New form i the compositin window, the feedbackwindow (the bottom-most window on the display) will tell you:	Message in composition window will be replaced.	Press DO to confirm or CANCEL to cancel command. Press DO for now, so that we can move on to the other commands.You should now have the Answer form on the display.  Answer fills in the "To"field with the sender's name of the currently displayed message and sets thesubject to be "Re:  sender's subject".  It also sets the "cc" field to include all ofthe recipients of the message being answered.  You may change the automaticreplacements by using the editing capabilities mentioned above.Now, mark Foward.  Forward copies the message body from the display windowinto the composition window and allows you to forward it to another Laureluser, by replacing the fields.  You can edit the message before sending it, ifthere is a section that may not be relevant.After marking either Answer or Forward you must complete the message byediting any remaining uninitialized fields in the message header and body. Mark New form and compose a message to another Laurel user.Ok, if you've filled in the "To" and "Subject" fields you can either delete the"cc" field or let someone else in on your masterpiece.  Look over your messagebody, changing it as you desire and when you've got it like you want it, movethe cursor up to Deliver in the menu and press the LEFT mouse button.The word Deliver gets shaded gray.  It's working!  Check the feedback window,during the delivery process.The cursor changes to an hourglass while it is delivering and when it hasfinally finished the word Deliver changes to an italicized delivered.Notice that the feedback window during this process was giving you informationabout your message.  It told you the number recipients (if more than 30 youneed to press DO to confirm) as it checks validity, the size of the message incharacters, and gave you one last chance to change your mind.Electronic communication complete!Before continuing,  the "Press DO to confirm, CANCEL to cancel command"message needs to be explained.  With this message, Laurel is warning you thatyou have not filed or delivered the message in the composition window and isgiving you the chance to save the message.  By pressing DO you are confirmingthat it's OK to continue with the command.  By pressing CANCEL Laurel givesyou the opportunity to complete the message.Mark Display for a lesson on Hardcopy, to print your messages. *start*02997 00024 US Date: 3 Jul 1980 9:36 pm PDT (Thursday)From: CaywoodTo: CaywoodSubject: Lesson 8cc: Before learning how to hardcopy a message, you must learn about a file called"Laurel.profile".  The Laurel.profile directs information about the printing of amessage to the printer, and can be edited.  Mark Get in the menu above the composition window.  Type the file nameLaurel.profile and press the DO key.  Note that there are no spaces inLaurel.profile and that there is a period between the two words.The only thing in the profile you will edit now is the name of your printingserver.  Be careful about making any other changes to the profile.  All lines inLaurel.profile are specific instructions to the system and affect Laurel.  On theline that says Hardcopy, replace the information field with your printer name ornetwork address.When you make changes to your Laurel profile you must save it by markingPut.  Put is similar to SaveAll in the EDITOR, except only one version of a file issaved.  Mark Put.  The cursor has moved to the brackets following the Putcommand, which allows you to rename the file.  Since you must not change thename of this file, press the DO key.  The feedback window tells you that Putwill overwrite the existing file, and asks for a confirmation.  Press the DO key.In order for any changes made to your Laurel profile, you must end your Laurelsession, return to the Executive and restart Laurel.  Read all the instructions inthe next sentence before actually doing what it says.  Mark Quit with the LEFTmouse button, press the DO key to confirm ending your session, restart Laurel,display Lesson 8, and scroll to this section to continue.Now you are ready to print (make a hardcopy) a message.  Marking Hardcopywill print one copy of the message selected in the table of contents on theprinter specified in your Laurel profile.  To print Lesson 8, mark Hardcopy. Notice that the feedback window tells you it is formatting the message by page, and sending it to your printer.  It also gives you the option to Cancel theHardcopy command by pressing the CANCEL key.  Your message is printed inthe form of a memorandum sheet.  If you have a Hy-Type Printer and you wantto print your messages on it, read Module 8 in the Laurel Training Workbookbefore attempting to do so.Laurel has no option for multiple copies.  Laurel will print multiple messages aslong as they are in sequence in the table of contents.  To print multiple messagesselect the first with the LEFT mouse button, and the last with the RIGHT mousebutton (like extend in the EDITOR).  If a message has been marked for deletion,it will not be printed even though it is included in the extended selection.Practice using the Hardcopy command and print some of the training messages.For more information on Laurel profile, refer to Module 8 in the TrainingCourse.When ready, mark Display for the next lesson (you may have to select Lesson 9).*start*01540 00024 US Date: 3 Jul 1980 9:58 pm PDT (Thursday)From: CaywoodTo: CaywoodSubject: Lesson 9cc: Suppose there is a group of people to whom you frequently send messages.  Youcan avoid having to type the entire list of names every time you send a messageto this group by creating a master list of their names.  We call this list aDistribution List.In the menu above the composition window mark New Form.  Delete all theinformation fields in the window and type in the authenticated user names to beincluded in your list, each separated by a comma and a space.  Do not put aRETURN at the end of the list.  A typical distribution list would like somethinglike this:Brown, Jones, Smith, RockefellerCreate a distribution list with the names of the users in this training class.  MarkPut to save the file and name it:  LocalUsers.dl.  Note that there are no spaces inthe name of the file.  There can be no spaces in any file name.  Now you havea file on your disk called LocalUsers.dl with the names of the class members.When composing a message in Laurel, the distribution list name may be used inthe "To" or "cc" field.  The .dl extension should be replaced by an up-arrowcharacter ^ (e.g. LocalUsers^).  The up-arrow tells Laurel that the name is adistribution list and not an individual user.When the message is delivered Laurel looks up the names in the file,  anddelivers your message to each of one.Mark New form and send a message to LocalUsers.When you are ready to continue, mark Display. *start*01068 00024 US Date: 3 Jul 1980 10:14 pm PDT (Thursday)From: CaywoodTo: CaywoodSubject: Lesson 10cc: Believe it or not, this is your last lesson in Laurel!  In this lesson you should learn one other use of Get and Put.One common use is after creating a long message, you may not be able to deliverit, or may want to take a break, and edit it at a later time.  Mark Put, name themessage (ex. temp.msg), and press the DO key.  To retrieve it, mark Get, type thename of the message, and press the DO key.More information about Laurel can be found in the Laurel Training Course &User Workbook.Before you terminate your Laurel session be sure you have not marked anyprecious messages for deletion.  As soon as you quit they will be gone forever. Also, this is a good time to categorize messages by moving them into other files,if you need to.To end your Laurel session, move the cursor into the top menu and mark Quit. The feedback window will ask you for confirmation (Press DO to confirm orCANCEL to cancel command).  Press DO.Enjoy!

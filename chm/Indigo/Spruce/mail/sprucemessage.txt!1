For narrow paper webs (11 inches andunder) there is no clear winner and several different methods should findlong-term usage depending upon the cost, resolution, speed, and qualityrequirements of the application.For wider paper webs, which are of particular interest to Versatec, the situationis somewhat clearer.  Many of the technologies are not easily scaled to large sizesand electrography, in its various forms, seems to have a clear advantage.CORJET, a new ion-projection method begun at PARC, offers the hope oflowering the cost of electrographic writing while improving the image quality aswell as providing a direct (non-transfer) plain-paper method.This Seminar is open to Xerox employees onlyHost:  Bill StreiferRefreshments 8-JAN-81 17:42:33-PST,1284;000000000000Date: 8 Jan. 1981 5:11 pm PST (Thursday)From: Pasco.PASubject: PARC FORUM, January 15, 1981To: PaloAlto^.PA, AllES^.ES, AllEOS^.EOS, AllHENR^.HENR, AllWBST^.WBSTRalph Kimball of SDD will speak on"CUSP, The Star Customer Programming LanguageA Demonstration of the 1981 Field Releases"Thursday, January 15, 1981, at 4:00 p.m. in the PARC cafeteria (Bldg. 35)(goodies at 3:45 p.m.)CUSP is the medium for office automation in the Star Professional Workstation. In this Forum, Ralph Kimball will demonstrate the CUSP facilities to be releasedto the field with Star during 1981.

His Abstract:   For a decentralised computing system consisting of many computing elements(whether geographically distributed mainframe computers, or miniaturecomputing elements within a single board or even chip) the prerequisite is a"naturally" decentralised model of computation.  This will allow a large numberof computing elements to co-operate in the execution of a program.   Computational models used in parallel (data flow, control flow, string andgraph reduction) computers help us to identify the attributes of such adecentralised and general-purpose model.  This seminar examines these fourclasses of parallel computational model, and presents a classification for theirunderlying concepts.  In addition, it gives a "kernel" computational model -called recursive control flow - which represents a synthesis of these underlyingconcepts, and hence supports as sub-models data flow, control flow, string andgraph reduction styles of computation.Phil will be here Thursday and Friday, and at Caltech the following week.

Directories that remain afterMaxc1 is gone will become Maxc2 directories only.  Over the years Maxc1 usershave changed their passwords as requested by administrators.  In many cases thepassword on Maxc2 was not changed in parallel.  This will pose a problem whenyou find yourself trying to login on Maxc2 and you can't remember that ancientpassword.  I have identified 164 directories which fall into this category.  I am aware thatsome of these are Maxc2 users already.  I will try to make an intelligent decisionas to who these are and I will leave those passwords alone.  But, admitting myhumanness, there are bound to be errors.  In changing the password I have tokey in two rather long octal numbers (10 to 12 characters each).  I feel that thefirst fifty or so will be relatively error free but my skepticism grows beyond that.  Sometime latter this week I will send out another message informing you that Ihave completed updating the Maxc2 passwords.  At that time you should trylogging in on Maxc2 and verifying that your password is correct.  Message me ifyou run into problems.  Also, if you know your Maxc2 password is different andyou don't want it changed, message me immediately.  Ron... 12-JAN-81 18:42:58-PST,360;000000000000Date: 12 Jan. 1981 6:41 pm PST (Monday)From: Ramshaw.PASubject: UPDATE: Clover's new fontsTo: SpruceInstallers^cc: RamshawI have just discovered that attempting to retrieve the new Spruce.Fontsfrom Ivy crashes IFS;  therefore, I respectfully recommend that nobodytry anything until I send word that the bug has been found and fixed,Lyle13-JAN-81 09:42:18-PST,483;000000000000Date: 13 Jan. 1981 9:36 am PST (Tuesday)From: Wilner.PASubject: Re: Distributed Computing Seminar, January 15, 1981In-reply-to: Wilner's message of 12 Jan. 1981 11:23 am PST (Monday)To: AllPA^In response to public clamor, and with Steve Weyer's kind cooperation, themeeting room has been changed to CSL Commons.

The major reasons are program efficiency andgiving more information about the data flow withing the program to theprogrammer.I have explored the use of type inference in a strongly typed language.  Thehope is that such a system would be able to keep all of the strong typingwithout requiring the user to specify types as rigorously.I have developed a program which infers types in Mesa using the generalUnification Algorithm (of Milner et al).  This works very well, and runs in 'nearlinear' time, for a broad subset of Mesa.I will demonstrate a simple system for partially specifying types in Mesa andshow examples of of how type checking and type inference can be doneidentically using this system.  I will show how constraints in a Mesa expressioncan be easily captured.The limits of this algorithm will be shown, and ways (that are not, alas, linear)are shown to extend the algorithm.------------------------------------------------------------14-JAN-81 15:08:18-PST,781;000000000000Date: 14 Jan. 1981 2:54 pm PST (Wednesday)From: RWeaver.PASubject: Files Moving to Maxc2To: PaloAlto^.paReply-To: RWeavercc: RWeaverAny files remaining in the following Maxc1 directories on Saturday morning(06:00, 17 Jan.) will be moved to Maxc2 to partially accomodate the migration ofthree disk drives to Maxc2.134, ALTO, ALTODOCS, ALTOFONTS, ALTOSOURCE, BBN-134, BOOTFILES,CSL-ARCHIVES, DEUTSCH, EXEC, FONTS, GAMES, IFS, KBA, LAUREL, MPS,NOVA, PRESSFONTS, PRINTING, PRINTINGDOCS, PUB, PUP, RFC, SAIL,SERVICES, SIL, SOURCES, SPRUCE, SPRUCESUPPORT, TAYLOR, THALES, &X-TELENET.  Archive-Directories will remain on Maxc1 and archive transactions willcontinue to be done there until the tape server is determined to be operational.  Ron...14-JAN-81 15:12:43-PST,1979;000000000000Date: 14 Jan. 1981 2:56 pm PST (Wednesday)From: Strollo.PASubject: A Digitally Mastered ConcertTo: PaloAlto^cc: StrolloOn Monday January 19 we will be playing some of the very new digitallymastered ANALOG discs in Building 35, room 3050 from 10AM thru about 6PM.This is to give those of you who have not had the opportunity a chance to hearthe latest state of the art in recording technology.

To get the full benefit ofthe new version, your Dover should have the new NewVec fonts aswell, since the old fonts had this thickening built in and the new onesdon't.  The new fonts are on	[Ivy]<Ramshaw>ReDraw>NewVec.Fonts.By the way, version 2.0 of ReDraw is about to be released, with coloras the major new feature.

File Transmissionz19050e12j(2116)\b17BUpgrade Spruce to use extended EFTP protocol, as defined in recent Taft memoranda.  When Sprint is running, respond with "wait a while".z19050e12jBreak Page Informationz19050e12j\b22BPrinted byz19050e12jCreated byz19050e12jPrinting Controlsz19050e12j\b17BInclude in all protocols capability for unique identifier for file to be supplied by client or server, used in subsequent communication re: file.z19050e12jEarly: include password in protocol; optional if file is to be printed right away, mandatory if accompanied by "hold for arrival".  Server implements decision whether to allow reprint of documents not accompanied by password; if password supplied, it must be entered at server to enable reprint, etc.	Later: use authentication servers, at least optionally, to avoid cleartext transmission of passwords.z19050e12jHold for arrival: mandatory password, file is marked "printed" or otherwise queued, with timeout, for printing later.  When user arrives at server and types password, file gets high priority.z19050e12jReprint or "Print now" command by network command? Similar password requirements.  Might be combined with capability spooling, below.z19050e12j# copies to print, page range to print -- allowed in commands accompanying file, in capability-style requests (below), or in reprint command (above).z19050e12jFont Informationz19050e12j\b16BFont transmission to printer -- temporary and/or permanent?  Bit maps at known printer resolution, as well as perhaps splines and other things.z19050e12jCapability Spoolingz19050e12j\b19BEarly: Send file name to printer, along with other print instance information.  Later: change file name to capability for file. Printer uses whatever protocol, but probably FTP, to get the file.z19050e12jDocument-wide, page-wide complexity informationz19050e12j\b47BColors used in document; colors used page by page.Overlapping objects do/do not appear in document, on individual pages (allows more efficient version of microcode if not.)z19050e12j"EARS" protocol extensionsz19050e12j\b26BReport on individual filesz19050e12jExtended report on state of system, including jam/low supplies reporting, load, backlog, scheduled down time, etc.z19050e12jReport of name, type, version, capabilities, of responding printer, in machine-processable form.z19050e12jUse of other printers, or other kinds of servers, to provide information about "down" printers.z19050e12jUse of registration servers, etc., to identify printers and their capabilities.z19050e12j

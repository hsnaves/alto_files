The Program may be retirieved from [IVY]<TapeServer>Software>MFTP.run. The program is written in Bcpl and should run on all of the PARC personal computers. The program is interactive in nature and therefore does not understand command line entries. The program is invoked by:e12jk40  MFTP.rune12jk40The program will respond with:e12jk40Magtape File Transfer Program, version 1.2, June 9, 1980Connect to (CR to exit program):x3e12jk40The present network name of the tape serving Alto is Saintpaulia. Once a connection is established, MFTP will respond with:e12jk40\53b11BOpen!e12jk40The program will then prompt for a command. The currently supported commands are:e12jk40? (Help), c(lose connection), r(ead), w(rite), f(ile skip forward), b(ack skip file) and u(rewind).e12jk40All commands should be self explanitory except for one caveat related to back skip file. Since tapes are a sequentially recorded media, files are deliniated with a special record called an EOF or tapemark. When a tape is forward skipped, the position of the tape head after the operation is after the EOF mark. If a back skip file is performed with the tape head positioned after an EOF the back skip will only skip over the EOF and not over any data records. Therefore the back skip must be performed again if the data records are to be skipped over as well.e12jk40e12jk40e12jk40e12j

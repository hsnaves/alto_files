At times, the specific application may be "pioneered" effectively with MODIFY and then find so much useage that a more efficient program will replace the MODIFY useage.e12\26b6BMODIFY has been designed so that options may be stated in the same request line as the program call-up.  This allows command file creation and useage (from a single typed line) that executes all steps needed to fully process an application.e36MODIFY itself is documented by a brief statement of the options, sub-options and file list statements it provides.  File list statements are referenced and documented at the end of the "option-suboption" information.* * * *e36Option: Location only modifyThis feature replace the "location" notation of each SIL schematic under the control of a Was-Is list  The "gate" suffix of the location-gate information is not effected.  For example, notation a03c would be changed to b02cunder the control of a Was-Is record showinga03 b02.l5292d2999e12(0,5184)Output: The entire schematic set as new files prefixed with E (for etch)l6174d2999e12Sub-option: None nowl6174d2999e12l6174d2999File list:  type A (see below)* * * *(635)l6174d2999(0,5184)Option: Gates and Locations modifyThis feature replace the "location & gate" notation of each SIL schematic under the control of a Was-Is list  Also, any one or two digit number field in font one (i.e. the I.C. pin numbers) are removed so that Analyze may re-assign them per the changed gate notation.  For example, notation a03c would be changed to b02dunder the control of a Was-Is record showinga03c b02d.l5292d2999Output: The entire schematic set as new files prefixed with E (for etch)l6174d2999e12Sub-option: None now l6174d2999e12File list:  type A (see below)l6174d2999e12* * * *(635)l6174d2999(0,5184)Option: Was-Is list creationThis feature is used primarly by DA operations. It is used to process information returning after a board on which the design is carried has been converted from stitch-weld to etch fabrication.  It is particularly intended to make a "location & gate" level Was-Is list on the basis of oldPin&oldLocation verses newPin&newLocation and ...dict.analyze information.   l5292d2999Output: The Was-Is list tracking the change from stitchweld to etchl6174d2999e12Sub-option: None now l6174d2999e12File list:  type B (see below)l6174d2999e12* * * * * * * * * * * * (635)File list type:A      e.g.   Modify/l d0cs.wasis d0cs*.sil    orA      e.g.   Modify/g d0cs.wasis d0cs*.silThis type list has the "Was-Is" file name first.   It is then followed by the input file list.  The input list will normally be typed in such a manner as to be expanded by the Alto executive into a many item list of individual file names.  See appendix one for details.l5292d2999\b1BFile list type:B      e.g.   Modify/w d0cs.wasis/o d0csmaster dictfile1 dictfile2 etc.This type list has the output file name first and it must be formatted as fid/o. The /o is required on the output list as a reminder to help avoid the accidental writing of information onto an intended input file.  It is then followed by the master list file showing old and new notation and pin numbers.  Finally there is a list of as many dictionary files as need to allow the program to make up pin number verses gate tables for all the parts in the design.l5292d2999\bMODIFY   Appendix One :  D    by R.

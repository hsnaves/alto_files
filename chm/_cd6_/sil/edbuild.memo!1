Rosen, 4/7/79)e30e10EdBuild is a specialized version of the BUILD program for controlling the release of revisions to a modules.  EdBuild uses and enforces the conventions established in "D0 Module Revision Control", Thacker and Kakita, 3/23/78.  EdBuild will run all the required programs from Analyze through FTP to generate the wirelist and documentation files required for a module.e12jk40EdBuild can be found on [MAXC]<SIL>EdBuild.Rune12jk40A build command line to EdBuild is:	EdBuild/AR nrev/R Card-BR/GB 100/GH E/GM Card*.silA rework command line to EdBuild is:	EdBuild/ARC orev/O nrev/R Card-BR/GB 100/GH E/GM Card*.silwhere:	orev is the Old revision letter	nrev is the New revision letter	card is the module name	Card-BR the the file specifying the modulee12jk40\48i4I3i7I17i3I57i4I3i4I3i7I17i3I15i4I29i4I29i4I21i7IEdBuild expects that you have the following files on your disk:	Card-orev.wl	The current wirelist	Card##.sil	The (edited) sil files for the logic	CardLayout.sil	CardChanges.sil	CardPlatforms.sil	e12jk40\65i4I1i4I26i4I45i4I12i4I13i4IThe program will check the current revision of all logic files against orev and the revision of the Layout, Platforms and Changes files against nrev.  It will change the revision of the logic sil files to nrev.e12jk40\71i4I69i4I57i4IBuild proceeds in 8 phases:	Phase 1 marks all sil files with "build marks", checking original revisions		and changing revision codes on logic files.	Phase 2 starts Analyze on the logic files (the "A" switch in the EdBuild		command line forces all logic files to be re-analyzed).	Phase 3 merges the .pn files with the .sil files.	Phase 4 renames the old wirelist file to Card01.wl and calls Route.	Phase 5 renames the old wirelist file back to Card-orev and call upon		Analyze to form the cross reference signal list.	Phase 6 renames the new wirelist file, the .ad file and the signal list to		the correct names.	Phase 7 calls SIL to make the press file out of all sil files.	Phase 8 calls FTP to dump the world out.e12jk40\376i4I70i4I1i4IIf EdBuild encounters an error, it writes a message on a file called Card.be or go to SWAT and, if the error is fatal, terminates the build.  If you can easily fix the problem, you can usually restart EdBuild back up on the phase that had an error by adding the phase number to the command line as in the following example:	EdBuild/ARC5 F/O G/R Card-BR/GB 100/GH E/GM Card*.sile12jk40\69i4I274i7I16i4IIf you need to restart EdBuild from the beginning, you may need to manually rename some files back to their original names.  Running EdBuild over again can also generate some non-fatal errors since the logic files might have been changed to the nrev and the program will be checking them against orev. However, EdBuild will continue and finish all the phases if no other fatal error occured. The revision-letter of the non-logic Sil-pages (pages with names other than Card##.sil) will not be altered by EdBuild; warnings will be given in Card.be if the revision letter mismatched to the command line. This is to remind the designer to update those non-logic Sil-pages. e12jk40\245i4I47i4I168i10I60i7IThe destination for the dump file (ie where the files will be dumped to) is defaulted to ISIS, under nonexisted account.  You must retreive the file [MAXC]<SIL>EdBuildbackuptemplate.cm and edit appropriately . EdBuild checks this file first, if it doesn't find the file on your disk, it uses it's built-in default.e12jk40If you use EdBuild on a module which is already been built by BUILD, you must rename the wirelist file from Card01.wl to Card-orev.wl. Otherwise, EdBuild goes to SWAT and complains about not find the expected WL-file; you can not continue from here.  e12jk40\108i4I9i4I1i4Ie12jk40

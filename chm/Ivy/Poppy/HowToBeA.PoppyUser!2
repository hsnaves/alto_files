This is file [Ivy]<Poppy>HowToBeA.PoppyUser.	All of the files you may need are on the directory [Ivy]<Poppy>.  They are:(1)	Poppy.Image  or  Poppy.bcd	To use Poppy.image you must have the Mesa 4.0 RunMesa.Run file on your	disk.  (There is one on [Ivy]<Poppy>.)  You can use Poppy.bcd if you have	a Mesa 4.0 system on your disk.  Poppy.bcd is about 94 pages, while 	Poppy.image is about 255 pages.  Warning: do not try to load Poppy	onto a disk containing Laurel 1.3 (the current version, as of 8/15/78).	Laurel expects a Mesa 3.0 system.(2) PoppyFont10.AL	This is just a copy of TimesRoman10.AL.  You can use other fonts if you like	but they can't be any taller than TimesRoman10. This is 6 pages long.(3) Poppy.Help  and  Poppy.Help+	These files are the documentation you see if you bug HELP inside Poppy.	These are about 10 pages altogether.(4) ZBravo.Run  and  BravoMacro.InitZ	ZBravo is a short BCPL program written by Bob Sproull which Poppy uses	in order to drop into Bravo quickly.  You also need to include the Bravo	Z macro which is in BravoMacro.InitZ into your user.cm for all this to 	work.  (Don't forget to re-initialize Bravo after changing user.cm) 	ZBravo.Run is 4 pages long.Once you've retrieved these files, you are ready to go.  The commands files	GetPoppyImageEtc.cm     or      GetPoppyBcdEtc.cm(both on [Ivy]<poppy>)  will retrieve all of (2)...(4) and either Poppy.imageor Poppy.bcd. 	Good Luck!

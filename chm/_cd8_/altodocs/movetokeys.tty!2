                              MoveToKeysThe Alto can boot-load a file beginning at any legal disk address.  Thedisk  address  is  supplied  by  holding  down  a  collection  of  keyssimultaneously  while  pressing   the  boot  button.    The  MoveToKeyssubsystem simplifies  the task of  getting a .boot  file to begin  at aspecified physical disk location.  To invoke MoveToKeys, type:MoveToKeys filename keylistto the Alto Executive.  "filename" is the name of the file  whose firstpage (technically,  page 1,  not page  0) is  to be  moved to  the diskaddress corresponding to "keylist".  The legal keys are 5, 4, 6,  7, D,E, K, P, U, V, 0, /, and  .  (Remember,  to  type  a  "/"  to  the AltoExecutive, you must quote it.) A typical use of MoveToKeys is:MoveToKeys Dumper DUThe file Dumper.boot  could then be boot-loaded  by holding down  the Dand U keys while pressing the boot button.MoveToKeys will prompt for parameters omitted from the command line andwill  complain if  any of  the parameters  supplied are  illegal.  (Forexample, not all subsets of  the set of legal keys correspond  to legaldisk addresses.)  In addition,  the global  switch /V  ("verbose mode")will  give  you   detailed  information  about  the   pages  MoveToKeysmanipulates.MoveToKeys  actually  works by  determining  what page  resides  at thespecified disk  address and swapping  it with page  1 of  the specifiedfile.   Depending upon  the pages  involved, MoveToKeys  must  patch upvarious pointers  within the  Alto file system  to ensure  a consistentrepresentation  of  files  and  directories.   (A  previous  version ofMoveToKeys did not do this correctly in all cases.)                             ------------                   Copyright Xerox Corporation 1979

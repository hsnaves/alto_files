                                PeekPupPeekPup is a small subsystem enabling one to peek at Pups going  to andfrom a particular Ethernet host.  It is intended as an aid in debuggingnew Pup software.PeekPup is invoked by the command    PeekPup hostnumber filenamewhere "hostnumber" is  the Ethernet address  (octal) of the  host whosepackets you  want to spy  on and "filename"  is the name  of a  file towrite the output on.  The program then looks for packets whose Ethernetsource or  destination address  is equal  to "hostnumber",  and buffersthem in  memory.  For each  Pup so processed,  "!" is displayed  on thescreen.  PeekPup terminates when any key is pressed, at which  point itinterprets the  last 200  Pups received  and writes  the result  on thespecified file.The output is mostly self-explanatory.  The numbers in the  left marginrepresent a  millisecond clock (with  no particular starting  value andwrapping around  at 32768).  For  each Pup, a  few lines of  output aregenerated; the information about Pups sent to the host being spied uponis indented further than information about Pups generated by that host.Pup headers are  fully interpreted, and  Pup contents are  displayed aseither text or a series of octal numbers representing bytes; large Pupsget only the initial  portion of their contents displayed,  followed by"...".                             ------------                   Copyright Xerox Corporation 1979

December 1978.Copyright Xerox Corporation 1979---Updated January 2, 1979  5:34 PM by MN  String searching added - the s switchUpdated December 4, 1979, by Peter Deutsch  File date comparisons, nested IFs addedUpdated July 9, 1982, by Dan Swinehart  Creation date comparison made explicit via /c switch---If implements conditional execution of groups of commandsto the Alto Executive.SYNTAXIf <condition> [then <commands>] [else <commands>]where [] denotes an optional clause, and  <condition> is one of:     filename         (yields true if file exists)     filename/l=N   (yields true if length of file = N)     filename/l<N   (yields true if length of file < N)     filename/l>N   (yields true if length of file > N)     filename/s"string"   (yields true if file contains string)  and N is a decimal constant     filename/r=otherfilename/r (yields true if read dates are equal)     (similarly for filename/r<otherfilename/r, etc.)     (similarly with either or both /r changed to /w -- write date)     (similarly with either or both /r changed to /c -- creation date)  <commands> is any string of Alto executive commands     separated by ';'.  Note necessity to escape semicolon past the Executive     command line reader.  Ifs can be nested by enclosing <commands> in braces ("{" and "}"): the braces     will be removed before the <commands> are passed to the Executive.SEMANTICSIn the case that <condition> yields true the <commands>in the then clause (if present) are passed to theExecutive for execution, otherwise the <commands> in theelse clause (if present) are passed."*" in the /s switch string matches zero or more file characters. Must escape past the Executive.EXAMPLE I:The mesa compiler creates an .errlog file only if there are errors.To enter bravo if there were errors, or the mesa system if not:  Compiler prog.mesa  If prog.errlog then bravo/m prog else mesa progThis is a modification of the m quit macro in bravo for  mesa.EXAMPLE II:BCPL always creates a transcript file.  However, the equivalent effect can be achieved by:  bcpl/f prog.bcpl  If prog.bt/s"ERROR" then bravo/b prog else bldr prog

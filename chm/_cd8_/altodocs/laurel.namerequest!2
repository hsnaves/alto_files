Please complete the following form to ensure prompt and correct naming of your Alto or D0.Step 1)  Grow this window so you have some room to work.  Do this by bugging the small square at the top right of this window with the middle bug.  Now, while still holding down the button, move the box straight up the screen to the top and release.Step 2)  Complete the appropriate sections below.  Bug the entry using the Middle button and replace with the appropriate information.Please be sure you are entering the CORRECT information!!! Entry Definitions:Name            - Will be the network name for your alto.Network         - The network number your alto is physically connected to.AltoNumber    - Number assigned to your alto.Location        - Room number that alto is in.Owner          - Your NameHeadings:ADDITIONS	For alto who currently do not have an entry in Pup-Network.DELETIONS	For alto removed from the network, unknown destination.CHANGES, MOVES & SWAPS	To avoid confusion please include OLD ENTRY.  This will hopefully eliminate mistakes, which cause names to mysteriously disappear form the network directory.  Also, If you are swapping with someone, send in your requests together, rather than sending two sepperate requests.Step 3)  Delete everything above the dotted line, including the line itself.          Delete lower parts of the memo that you do not need.Setp 4)  Send the message.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: Alto NamingTo: NetSupport.Wbstcc: CopiesTo*** ADDITIONS ***Name

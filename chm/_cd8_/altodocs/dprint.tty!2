                    DPrint - Diablo Printer ProgramThis program  types text  files on  a Diablo  printer connected  to theAlto.  It is  a vanilla program with  very few features.  Use  Bravo ifDPrint's facilities are inadequate.The syntax of the command line is:    DPrint/switch parameter/switch ... filename filename ...The only switch permitted on the word "DPrint" is "/P", which instructsDPrint to pause before the beginning of each page.One or more parameters may optionally be specified:     n/W  Sets the line  width to be  n characters.  Lines  longer than          this will wrap  around to the next  line.  The default  is 75          characters.     n/L  Sets  the page  length to  be n  lines.  This  determines the          point at which  printout will pause  (if /P was  invoked) and          also controls the amount of paper spewed when a  form-feed is          encountered in the file.  The default is 66 lines (11 inches)          if /P is not in effect or 57 lines (9.5 inches) if it is.     n/M  Sets the  left margin  to be n  units of  1/10 inch  from the          hardware left margin of the printer.  The default is zero.Command line  parameters without  switches are assumed  to be  names oftext files to be printed.  If a file cannot be found or a  parameter isotherwise incorrect, you will be prompted for the correct value.When DPrint pauses, you may either type space to resume printout or "Q"to abort it and quit out of the program.  DPrint will pause immediatelyif you strike  any key while  it is printing,  and also if  the printerbecomes not ready.                             ------------                   Copyright Xerox Corporation 1979

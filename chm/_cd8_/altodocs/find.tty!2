                   Find - a file searching subsystemThe Find subsystem allows you  to search text files at very  high speedon an Alto.  Examples of such files might be an address/telephone list,a source program, or a library catalog.Find basically looks  for all the occurrences  of a pattern in  a file,just like doing repeated Jump  commands in Bravo.  A pattern is  just acharacter sequence, except for the following:      # in  a pattern means  "any character at  all", e.g. CAP  and CUPcount as occurrences of the pattern C#P.      ~ in a  pattern means "allow one  character in the  occurrence todisagree  with  the  corresponding  character  in  the  pattern".   Forexample, LAP, CUP, and CAT all count as occurrences of the pattern ~CAP(or CAP~ or C~AP).  Two  ~s mean "allow two disagreements", and  so on.Note  that "disagreement"  only  means substituting  one  character foranother: it does not include insertions (e.g. CLAP for  CAP), deletions(CP for CAP), or transpositions (CPA for CAP).      If you really want to have a pattern containing # or ~,  you haveto type a ' before it,  e.g. to search for the character  sequence ATOM#, you have to type ATOM '#.      Unless you use  the /c (Case)  switch described below,  upper andlower case letters are considered identical, e.g. Cap, cap, and CAP allcount as occurrences of CAP or of cap.      Unless  you use  the /s  (Space) switch  described  below, blanks(spaces) in the file  are completely ignored, e.g.  C A P counts  as anoccurrence of CAP; blanks in the pattern are also ignored.There are two ways to invoke Find.  The first way just searches  a filefor one pattern:      >Find filename pattern(Since the Executive does something special about @, #, %, *, ^,  and ;in command  lines, you  must precede  any of  these characters  in yourpattern  by a  '.   This is  in  addition to  any  's you  may  need asdescribed in the preceding  paragraph.)  The second way  only specifiesthe file:      >Find filenameand Find then prompts you repeatedly for patterns.  To leave  Find whenusing it this way, use  shift-Swat or type an empty pattern  (just type<return> when  Find says Pattern:).   You can also  use Find  to searchseveral files together, by invoking it with      >Find/m filename1 ... filenamenwhich also prompts you for patterns.In any of the above command lines, you can also use the /c,  /d, and/or/s switches described above, i.e. any of the forms      >Find/s filename pattern      >Find/s filename      >Find/ms filename1 ... filenamenThe switches may be in any order or combination, e.g.      >Find/csm filename1 ... filenamentells Find to search  filename1 ... filenamen treating upper  and lowercase as different  and not ignoring spaces.   This also applies  to theswitches described below.                             ------------                   Copyright Xerox Corporation 1979Find                       November 6, 1979                           2After completing the search, Find  displays at the top of the  screen asummary of the form:      79 occurrences, 1200 ms, 150 pagesgiving the total number  of occurrences, the time in  milliseconds, andthe number of disk pages in the file.  In the remainder of  the screen,Find displays the  line containing each  occurrence of a  pattern, withthe occurrence indicated  in boldface.  To the  left of the  line, Finddisplays the character  position in the  file where the  occurrence wasfound.  After each screenful, Find waits for you to type <space> if youwant more, or <del> if you don't.In addition to displaying matches on the screen, Find always writes thelines containing matches on a file called Find.Matches.  Normally, Findonly writes  those matches which  it displayed, so  if you  stopped thedisplay of matches with <del>, only those matches you actually saw willappear on the file.  However, if you use the /a (All) switch, Find willwrite all matches on the file, not just the ones you saw  displayed; ifyou use the /w (Write only) switch, Find will write all matches  on thefile and not display them at all.What Find finds  for you is all  the "items" containing  occurrences ofthe  pattern.   Normally an  "item"  is  just a  single  line  of text,delimited by  <cr> on both  ends.  However, Find  also knows  about twoother kinds of items:  Bravo paragraphs, and groups of  lines separatedfrom each other by a blank line.  If you use the /p (Paragraph) switch,Find will  show (display  and write on  Find.Matches) the  entire Bravoparagraph containing the  occurrence.  If you  use the /b  (Blank line)switch, Find will show everything surrounding the occurrence up  to thenext preceding and following blank line.So that you can examine Find.Matches with Bravo, Find  normally removesany  character  sequences  that  Bravo  might  confuse  with   its  ownformatting information.  There are two exceptions to this.  If  you askfor entire paragraphs (/p  switch), Find preserves the  formatting.  Iffor  some  reason  you  want the  characters  around  the  match copiedregardless of their possible  interpretation by Bravo (e.g. if  you aresearching a binary file or some unusual kind of text file), you can usethe /v (Verbatim) switch, which instructs Find not to  remove sequencesthat look like Bravo formatting; if you do this, you will  probably notbe able to read the file into Bravo with the ordinary Get  command, butshould use the ^Z (unformatted Get) command instead.Find  normally  displays,  but  does  not  write  on  Find.Matches, theposition of  each occurrence within  the file, in  octal.  If  you wantthis number written Find.Matches as well, use the /o (Octal) switch.Find produces a large number of error messages.  The messages      Pattern too long      Can't preallocate      RAM fullall mean the same  thing, namely that your  pattern is too long  or toocomplicated (unfortunately,  it is too  complicated to  explain exactlywhat "too complicated" means).  The message      Can't load RAMmeans that  your Alto has  old or non-standard  ROMs and Find  can't dowhat it needs to do:  you should contact a hardware  maintainer.  (Thisshould never happen on Alto II's.)Find has many obvious limitations.   They can all be removed  if peopleFind                       November 6, 1979                           3complain about them.  The  following features could also be  added uponrequest:      Boolean combinations of matches, maybe.      Ability to work with Trident disks.      Possibly other features requested by users.Programmers  should note  that the  file searching  capability  is alsoavailable as a library package (called FindPkg), so programs can use itas well as people.Alphabetic summary of switches:      /a - write All matches on file      /b - item = text between Blank lines      /c - distinguish between upper and lower Case      /m - Multiple files      /o - write Octal position on Find.Matches      /p - item = Bravo Paragraph      /s - consider Spaces significant      /v  -  write  Verbatim  on  Find.Matches  (don't  strip  possibleformatting)      /w - only Write on Find.Matches, don't displayHistory of changes:Release of October 30, 1979      Added /o (write octal position), /v (verbatim output  of matches,i.e. don't flush Bravo formatting), /a (write all matches to file), and/w  (only  write  matches, don't  display).   Fixed  bugs  which causeddisplay garbage and occasional  crashes when lines were very  long, andinfinite loop when searching files containing <del>s.   Changed defaultto remove  Bravo formatting from  matches file unless  /p or  /v switchset.Release of January 16, 1978      Added  /c  (distinguish  upper  and  lower  case),  /p   (item  =paragraph), and /b (item = between blank lines) switches.

Lampsonz18697jcx1e12February 11, 1976z18697jcx1z18697jx1e30This manual describes the Bravo system for creating, reading and changing text documents on the Alto.  It is supposed to be readable by people who do not have previous experience with computers.  You should read the first four sections of the Non-Programmers Guide to the Alto before starting to read this manual.z18697jx1e12You will find that things are a lot clearer (I hope) if you try to learn by doing.  Try out the things described here as you read.z18697jx1e12\67i14II would appreciate any comments which occur to you while trying to use the manual.  In particular, I would like to know what you found to be confusing or unclear, as well as anything which you found to be simply wrong.z18697jx1e12This manual is written on the assumption that you have the user profile, fonts and other Bravo-related material from the Basic Non-programmer's disk.  If this is not the case, some of the things which depend on that stuff will not work the same way.z18697jx1e12There is a one-page summary of Bravo at the end of this manual.  It is intended as a memory-jogger, not as a complete specification of how all the commands work.z18697jx1e12Bravo was designed by Butler Lampson and Charles Simonyi, and implemented mainly by Tom Malloy, with help from Kate Rosenbloom.z18697jx1e121. Introductionz18697jx1e30\bBravo is the standard Alto system for creating, editing and printing documents containing text.  It can handle formatted text, but it doesn't know how to handle pictures or drawings; for these you should use Markup or Draw.z18697jx1e12When you start up Bravo (do it now, by saying Bravo/eCR to the Executive), you will see two windows on the screen, separated by heavy horizontal lines.  The top one contains four lines with some useful introductory information; it is called the system window.  The bottom one contains a copy of the material you are reading, which was put there because of the "/e" you typed to the Executive.  If you had omitted the "/e", the bottom window would be empty, except for a single triangular endmark which indicates the end of a document.z18697jx1e12\46u7f1o9 2f0o0U190i13I230b7BAs you do things in Bravo, the first two lines of the system window will give you various useful pieces of information which may help you to understand what is going on and to decide what you should do next.  Usually, the top line tells you what you can do next, and the second line tells you what you just did, and whether anything went wrong in doing it.  Make a habit of looking at these two lines while you are learning Bravo, and whenever you are unsure of what is happening.z18697jx1e12\358i121INo matter what is going on in Bravo, you can stop it and get back to a neutral state by hitting the DEL key.  You can leave Bravo and get back to the Executive by typingz18697jx1e12\100f1 3f0QuitCRz18697l4268d4268p1jx1\u1U3f1o9uNotice that you only type the first character of the quit command; this is true for all the Bravo commands.z18697jx1Each Bravo window contains a document which you can read and change.  Usually you read the document from a file when you start Bravo, and write it back onto a file after you have finished changing it.  Later, you will find out how to do this.  It is possible to have several windows, each containing a document; this too is explained later on.z18697jx1e12\29i8IBravo is controlled partly from the keyboard and partly from the mouse, the small white object with three black buttons which sits to the right of the keyboard.  As you push the mouse around on your working surface, a cursor moves around on the screen.  Pushing the mouse to the left moves the cursor to the left, pushing the mouse up (away from you) moves the cursor up; and so forth.  You should practice moving the mouse around so that the cursor moves to various parts of the screen.z18697jx1e12\65i5I148i6IThe three buttons on the mouse are called RED (the top or left-most one, depending on what kind of mouse you have), YELLOW (the middle one) and GREEN (the bottom or right-most one).  They have different functions depending on where the cursor is on the screen and what shape it has.  Don't push any buttons yet.z18697jx1e12\42f1 3f0 71f1 6f0 22f1 5f0Mouse lore:z18697jx1e12You will find that the mouse works better if you hold it so that it bears some of the weight of your hand.z18697l4268d4268p2jx1e4If the cursor doesn't move smoothly when the mouse is moving, try turning the mouse upside down and spinning the ball in the middle with your finger until the cursor does move smoothly as the ball moves.  If this doesn't help, your mouse is broken; get it fixed.z18697l4268d4268p1jx1e4\205f1You can pick the mouse up and move it over on your work surface if you find that it isn't positioned conveniently.  For instance, if you find the mouse running into the keyboard when you try to move the cursor to the left edge of the screen, just pick the mouse up and move it to the right.z18697l4268d4268p1jx1e42. Basic featuresz18697jx1e30\bThis section describes the minimum set of things you have to know in order to do any useful work with Bravo.  When you have finished this section, you can read the other parts of the manual as you need the information.z18697jx1e202.1 Moving aroundz18697jx1e20\iMove the cursor to the left edge of the screen and a few lines down from the top of this document.  Notice that its shape changes to a double-headed arrow.  It will keep this shape as long as you stay near the left edge, in a region called the scroll bar.  If you move it too far right, the shape will change.  Keep the cursor in the scroll bar for the moment.z18697jx1e12\244i10INow push down the RED (top or left) button and hold it down.  Notice that the cursor changes to a heavy upward arrow.  This indicates that when you let the button go, the line the cursor is on will be moved to the top of the window.  Try it.  This is called scrolling the document up.z18697jx1e12\18f1 3f0 237i9INext push down the GREEN (bottom or right) button and hold it down.  Now the arrow points down, indicating that when you let the button go, the top line on the screen will be moved down to where the cursor is, or perhaps a bit further.  Try it.  This operation takes a few seconds, so don't get impatient.  Practice scrolling the document up and down until you feel comfortable with it.z18697jx1e12\19f1 5f0You may have noticed that the text on the screen doesn't fill up the window, but that more text appears when you scroll up.  The reason for this is that in addition to space on the screen, Bravo needs space inside itself (in the Alto's memory) to display lines of text on the screen.  When a line has only a few characters, it doesn't take up much internal space, but when it runs all the way across the page, like the lines in this document, it takes a lot of internal space.  When Bravo runs out of internal space, it stops displaying text and leaves the rest of the window blank.  You can tell that there is more text in the document (i.e., that you aren't seeing the end), because when Bravo gets to the end it displays a triangular endmark as the very last thing to mark the end.  If you don't see the endmark at the bottom of the displayed text, you can be sure that there is more text in the document which isn't being displayed.z18697jx1e12\737b7B63b7BIf you keep the cursor in the scroll bar, near the left edge, and hold down YELLOW (the middle mouse button), you will see the cursor change into a small rectangle.  Think of it as a thumb, and the entire left edge of the window as the pages of a closed book, corresponding to your whole document (not just to what is displayed).  If you stick the thumbnail into the book and flip it open, you will find yourself someplace in the book.  If the thumb is near the middle, you will be about in the middle.  If it is all the way at the top, you will be at the beginning; if all the way at the bottom, you will be at the end.z18697jx1e12\76f1 6f0 216i3IThe top edge of the rectangle acts like the thumbnail, and letting go of YELLOW is like flipping open the book.  To get to the beginning, push the rectangle up until its top edge is a little over the horizontal line at the top of the window.  Try thumbing your way through the document until you feel comfortable with it.  Also try thumbing and then scrolling up and down.z18697jx1e12\73f1 6f02.2 Changing the textz18697jx1e20\iIn order to make a change in the text of your document, you have to:z18697jx1e12say where you want the change made, by making a selection;z18697l4268d4268p1jx1\48isay what you want done, by giving a command.z18697l4268d4268p1jx1\36i7IYou always make the selection first, then give the command.  If you change your mind about where you want the change made, you can always make another selection.  Making a selection is just like pointing with a pencil: it doesn't have any effect on the document.  Only commands can change the document.  You never have to worry about getting rid of a selection, since it never does any harm.  If you make a selection, and then give a command that doesn't require any selection, that is perfectly all right; the needless selection will be ignored.z18697jx1You make selections by pointing with the mouse and pushing one of the buttons.  To try this out, move the cursor into the region of the screen where the text of the document is displayed.  Notice that the cursor is displayed as an arrow which points up and slightly to the left.  Point the arrow at a character (any character) in the document, and click RED.  The character you pointed at should be underlined; if it is, you have just selected it.  If it isn't, look nearby and see if some other character is underlined.  If you find one, then that is the one Bravo thought you were pointing at.  Experiment until you feel confident that you can point easily at characters.z18697jx1e12\354f1 3f0 92f1 146f0You should note that each selection erases the previous one; there is only one selection at a time, and it is the most recent one.  Also, you can make a selection at any time, except when you are in the middle of a command.  Once you have started a command, you must either finish it normally, or abort it by striking DEL, before you can make another selection.z18697jx1e12\318f1 3f0Something useful to know: if you hold RED down, you can move the cursor around and the selection will follow it.  The selection won't freeze until you release RED (or move the cursor out of the text area).  Try this too.z18697jx1e12\38f1 3f0 118f1 3f0Now try a selection using YELLOW instead of RED.  Notice that instead of underlining a character, Bravo now underlines a whole word.  A word is defined as consecutive letters and digits, or consecutive punctuation characters. For convenience, apostrophe is counted as a letter.z18697jx1e12\26f1 6f0 12f1 3f0 179f1There is one more thing to learn about selecting text: how to select more than one character or one word.  To do this, first select a character with RED.  Then point to another character and click GREEN; Bravo will underline all the characters between the one you selected with RED and the one you pointed at with GREEN.  This is called extending the selection.  Try holding down GREEN and moving the cursor around.  The selection will change continuously so that it includes the characters between the one you originally selected with RED and the one you are pointing at now.  As before, when you let up the button, the selection will freeze.  You can change the extension as many times as you want by using GREEN over and over; Bravo will remember the original selection you made with RED until you make another one.z18697jx1e12\149f1 3f0 45f1 5f0 76f1 3f0 33f1 5f0 18i9I34f1 5f0 151f1 3f0 170f1 5f0 73f1 3f0Finally, try selecting a word with YELLOW and then using GREEN to extend the selection.  Notice that the end of the selection will be a word also.z18697jx1e12\35f1 6f0 16f1 5f0Space, TAB and carriage return (CR) characters in the document simply appear as white space on the screen, just as they do on paper.  You can, however, select them like any other characters.  Try it.  You will notice that not all the white space on the screen can be selected; in fact, the space on a line after a CR, and the space to the left of the left margin, cannot be selected.  Bravo's handling of white space is disucssed in detail in section 3.5.z18697jx1e12\7f1 3f0 22f1 2f0 280f1 2f0Now that you know how to say where you want a change made, it's time to make a change.  Select something (for instance, a word).  Now type D (for Delete).  The word you selected is deleted from the document, and the selection moves over to the character after the original selection.  The rest of the text is adjusted to make up for the deleted material; if necessary some words may be brought up from the next line to fill up the one which contained the deleted material.z18697jx1e12\139u1U41i7IYou can undo the deletion by typing U (for undo).  Try it; you will see the stuff you deleted reappear, and it will be selected again, just as it was before you deleted it.  Do several deletions, followed by undos, until you are sure you know what will happen.  Try deleting larger pieces of text by extending your selections.  Be sure not to move the selection between doing the Delete and the Undo.z18697jx1e12\8i4I24u1UDelete and Undo are commands.  Like all Bravo commands, they are given by typing just the first letter of the command name.  You can type the letter in either upper or lower case.z18697jx1e12\20i8ITo add new text, select something in front of which you want the new text to go.  Then type I (for insert).  You will see that a blinking caret appears just before the selection.  This marks the place where the new text will go.  Anything you type will appear where the caret is, and as you type each character, the caret will move over to make room for it.  Try typing a few characters, and notice that the rest of the text is automatically rearranged to make room for the new stuff.z18697jx1e12\92u1U6i6IIf you strike the wrong key while typing, you can erase the mistake by striking the BS key (on the right side of the keyboard).  You can erase as many typed characters as you like using BS.  To erase typing on a larger scale, you can use Wc (hold down the CTRL key and type W) to erase a word and its following spaces or punctuation characters.  You can also use Qc to erase a whole line.  When you have typed as much as you care to, hit ESC to finish the insert.  Notice that the caret disappears, and that the inserted material is selected.  You can undo the insertion with Undo.  Then you can undo the undo and get the insertion back.  Try it.z18697jx1e12\84f1 2f0 100f1 2f0 51f1o4 1f0o0 16f1 4f0 104f1o4 1f0o0 73f1 3f0 135u1USometimes it is more convenient to insert after a selection, rather than before.  You can do this with the Append command (remember that you just type the A).  Except for where the new material goes, Append is exactly like Insert.z18697jx1e12\42i5I26i6I28u1UIf you want to change one word into another, or correct a typo, you have to delete some text and insert other text in its place.  This can be done by a Delete followed by an Insert, but it is more convenient to use the Replace command, which combines these two functions into one.  Replace can also be undone.z18697jx1e12\219u1UWhenever Bravo first displays the blinking caret, you can insert a copy of some existing text rather than typing in new text.  You do this by making another selection, called a copy selection, instead of typing.  The copy selection is made exactly like an ordinary selection, and you can even use the scroll bar to move around in the document in order to find the text you want to copy.  You can distinguish a copy selection from an ordinary one by its dotted underline, which contrasts with the solid underline of an ordinary selection.z18697jx1e12\67i4I106i14IYou can change your copy selection as many times as you like.  When you are satisfied with it, type ESC, and a copy of the copy selection will be inserted in place of the blinking caret.  You can't do anything else while you are making a copy selection, except to scroll the document.z18697jx1e12\100f1 3f0A copy selection can be used to move text from one place to another:  first copy the text, and then delete the original.z18697jx1e12There is one more useful thing to know about insertion.  If you just type an ESC for an insertion, without making a copy selection or typing anything else, a copy of the last thing you inserted or deleted will be inserted.  This is called repeating or defaulting an insertion; it is very convenient for inserting the same thing in several places, e.g., a dollar sign in front of several numbers.  It also gives you another way to move text:  first delete it, and then insert it in its new place by using ESC.z18697jx1e12\77f1 3f0 172i10I242f1 3f0You now know all three ways of doing an insertion: typing the text, selecting some existing text to be copied, or defaulting the previous insertion by simply typing ESC.  These three ways of inserting text can be used whenever a Bravo command needs some text.  You will see many references to "inserting text" as you read on.z18697jx1e12\51i6I11i9I37i10I41f1 3f0Before going on to learn anything more about Bravo, you should practice the Delete, Insert, Append and Replace commands, and copy selections, until they are quite familiar.z18697jx1e122.3 Filing and Hardcopyz18697jx1e20\iWhether you use Bravo simply to read or browse through a document, or to create or change it, you will need to fetch the document from a file before starting, and to file it away again afterwards.  This section tells you how to do these things.z18697jx1e12To fetch a document from a file, give the Get command.  You will see the blinking insertion caret near the lower left corner of the system window, in the file name buffer.  Insert the text of the file name, usually by typing it in, and ending it with an ESC just as for any other insertion.  The document will appear in the document window, and there will be a note in the system window telling you how long it is.  Warning: Get does not erase anything; it just reads in the file and puts it in front of the current selection.  To erase the contents of the window, do Everything Delete.z18697jx1e12\42u1U111i16I84f1 3f0 159i7I11i3I131u1U10u1UTo file a document away, give the Everything command, and then the Put command, and type the file name as you did for Get.  If the name you want is already in the file name buffer, you can just type ESC to default the name.  After the document has been filed away, you will again see a note which tells you how long it is.  Warning: If you quit from Bravo without saving your document, you will lose any changes you have made.  If this does happen to you, read section 4.3 on replaying to see if you can still be saved.z18697jx1e12\34u1U32u1U131f1 3f0 122i7I97f1If you Get a document from a file and Put it back on the same file, Bravo will save a copy of the original on a backup file, whose name is the name of the original file, followed by a "$".  This is sometimes useful if you discover that some of the changes you made are not to your liking after all.z18697jx1e12\112i6ITo print a document, simply give the Hardcopy command.  After sending the document to the Ears printer, Bravo will report success.  If there is a problem, Bravo will leave a note in the system window.  If the problem is that the printer is not responding, it is worthwhile to try two or three times.  If the problem is that there is a character in your document which is in a font for which you don't have the necessary .ep file, Bravo leaves one of the offending characters selected.  You can give the Normalize command to bring the selection to the top of the screen.z18697jx1e12\37u1U263f1 202u1UYou may want more than one copy of your document.  The Hardcopy command has an option called Copies, which allows you to specify the number of copies you want; the number will appear in one of the buffers in the system window, much like a file name.  You must give the Copies option right after the Hardcopy command, every time you want more than one copy.z18697jx1e12\93u1U175u1UIf you compare the hardcopy of your document with Bravo's display, you will see that although the text is identical, the hardcopy has more words on each line, so that the two versions look quite different.  In order to see a nearly exact facsimile of the hardcopy on the screen, you can give the commandz18697jx1e12Look Magnify 1z18697l4268d4268p1jx1\u1U4u1U7uYou are now in hardcopy mode on the screen.  Until further notice, Bravo will represent the printed version of your document as faithfully as it can. The only significant difference between the display and the hardcopy will be in the width of the spaces between words -- it is in these spaces that Bravo makes up for the physical differences between the two media.  If a line has only one or two spaces, they may be compressed to almost nothing; should this happen, you can improve the situation by appending a couple of spaces to the short line.z18697jx1e12\15i13ITo turn off the hardcopy simulation, give the commandz18697jx1Look Magnify CLR (CLR is the blank key to the right of BS)z18697l4268d4268p1jx1\u1U4u1U7f1u3f0U2f1 3f0 34f1 2f0You can edit normally in hardcopy mode.  In fact, if your document has any lines with TABs in the middle, it is advisable to stay in this mode.  In the normal mode, TABs may behave differently on the screen and on the paper, but in hardcopy mode they are guaranteed to be the same.z18697jx1e12\86f1 4f0 75f1 4f0When Bravo is printing a hardcopy, it will start a new page, after printing the current line, whenever it sees the character Lc (control-L) in the text.  This character is displayed as a lower case "l" with an over-bar.  You can't type it in simply by holding down CTRL and typing l, but instead you can type an "l" followed by Sc.  You do this during an insertion, not as a command.  The Lc is treated just like any other character during editing.z18697jx1e12\126f1o4 1f0o0 138f1 4f0 60f1o4 1f0o0 15i19I26f1o4 1f0o02.4 Miscellaneousz18697jx1e15\iAs you edit, Bravo keeps track of the changes you make to the document.  In doing this, Bravo consumes space in the Alto memory.  During a long editing session, it is possible to consume all the available space, in which case Bravo will leave a warning note in the system window, and will refuse to execute any more editing commands.  If this happens, you should Put your document onto a file immediately, and then Quit, restart Bravo, and Get the document back from the file.  Now you can continue with another editing session.z18697jx1e12When you have finished editing one document and have filed it away, you can erase it by typing Everything Delete, Get another file, and continue working.  It you are making extensive changes, however, it is better to Quit and restart Bravo when you start to work on a new document.  If you do this, you are less likely to provoke a bug in Bravo, and you will be able to recover from a crash with the replay feature (section 4.3) much more quickly.z18697jx1e12The maximum size of a Bravo document is 65,536 characters.  Whenever Bravo Gets of Puts a document, it leaves a note telling you how long the document was.  If it was more than half the maximum size, the note will contain a negative number, which is counting down toward 0 as the document gets larger.  When it reaches 0, your document has reached 65,536 characters, and you won't be able to add any more.  It is a good idea to split the document into two parts well before this happens.z18697jx1e12You now know enough to edit unformatted documents.  Take a rest.z18697jx1e123. Formattingz18697jx1e30\bThis section describes the Bravo facilities for creating formatted text.  It you are not interested in formatted text, you don't have to read it.  If you are interested, be sure to read sections 3.3 and 3.4, where you will find a lot of good advice.z18697jx1e203.1 Making pretty charactersz18697jx1e20\iBravo allows you to say how you want your text printed:  in italics or bold face, underlined, in various sizes and type styles, superscripted or subscripted, etc.  You can change the way existing text is printed, or you can say how you want the characters to appear as you are typing them in.  We will begin by describing how to change the looks of existing text.z18697jx1e12First, select the text you want to mess with.  Then give the Look command.  This command has a large number of options, each specified by a single letter, which is sometimes followed by some additional information:z18697jx1e12\61u1Ubold			shift B to un-boldz18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U6u7U`italic			shift I to un-italicizez18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\1u1U8u7U- to underline			shift - to remove the underlinez18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U16u7U_ to subscript			shift _ or ^ to superscriptz18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U16u7U4u1U0-9 to set the typefacez18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3visible to display spaces, tabs	shift V to stop this. and carriage returnsz18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U31u7UOffset followed by a number to move the text up that many points.  A point is 1/72 inch on the hardcopy; lines are about 10 points high.  A negative number will move the text down.  The number is like any insertion:  typed, selected or defaulted, terminated by ESC.  Look _ and Look ^ are equivalent to Look Offset 4 and -4 respectively.z18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U260f1 3f0CLR (the blank key to the right of BS) to restore the standard looks: font 0; not bold, italic, underlined, visible; offset 0.z18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\f1u3f0U32f1 2f0Try a few.  You can turn all these on and off independently, although you won't be able to print a character which is both bold and italic with the fonts on the basic disk.z18697jx1e12The typeface is usually called the font. For Bravo, each different size of the same style is a different font, but bold and italic are considered to be in the same font.  The choice of fonts is specified by your user profile in a way which is described later (in section 4.6), but the standard choice provided on the basic non-programmer's disk is:z18697jx1e12\35i4I173i12I0	Times Roman, 10 pt.

It is Look Same, followed by a copy selection.  In this case, what is copied  is the looks, rather than the characters.  This is the way to get one piece of text to print in the same style as another piece.z18697jx1e12\62u1U4u1ULike most commands, Look can be repeated with ESC.  This is useful if you want to change the looks of several pieces of text in the same way.  You can also undo a Look with Undo.z18697jx1e12\46f1 3f0To change the looks while you are typing text, use the CTRL key instead of the Look command:  hold down CTRL and type the look you want.  The only thing described above which you can't do this way is to set the offset.  To restore the standard looks, you can just strike the CLR key; it is not necessary to use CTRL in this case.z18697jx1e12\55f1 4f0 45f1 4f0 167f1 3f0 33f1 4f0When you start typing, the looks are set to the looks of the first character after the caret.  This is true regardless of whether the command was insert, delete, replace or something else.  Of course you can get the default looks back by typing CLR.  For typing into the system window (e.g. for Jump or Get) the looks are set to their default values.z18697jx1e12\77i5I163f1 3f03.2 Paragraphsz18697jx1e20\iIn addition to changing the looks of the characters, you can also change the shape of the text:  the margins, space between lines, justification, centering, etc.  The Bravo facilities for doing this are based on the idea of a paragraph.z18697jx1e12\226i9IA paragraph in Bravo is all the text between two CTRL-CR characters.  You can tell when you have one by selecting it, using the YELLOW button in the line bar.  This button selects exactly one paragraph, so by looking at what is underlined you can tell where the paragraph starts and ends.  Note that the second CTRL-CR (the one which ends the paragraph) is counted as part of the paragraph.z18697jx1e12\49f1 7f0 72f1 6f0 177f1 7f0To merge two paragraphs into one, just delete the CTRL-CR which separates them.  You will probably want to replace it with a couple of spaces, or maybe with an ordinary CR.  To break one paragraph into two, insert a CTRL-CR; it is just like any other character, except that you can't backspace over it.z18697jx1e12\50f1 7f0 112f1 2f0 45f1 7f0To change the looks of a paragraph, you can use some more sub-cases of the Look command.  Select the paragraph (or any text in it) first, and then say Look, followed by:z18697jx1e12\151u1UCenter		shift C to stop centeringz18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U7u7UJustify (even right margin)	shift J to stop justifyingz18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U27u7UUp to indent (36 pts)		shift U or Down to un-indentz18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U22u7U4u1UXc to double-space (6 pts)	shift Xc to single-spacez18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1f1o3 1f0o0U25u7f1o3 1f0o0UEc to double-space before	shift Ec to single-space there  the paragraph (12 pts)z18697l4268d4268p1jx1\u1f1o3 1f0o0U24u7f1o3 1f0o0UIn the following Look cases, n is a number which you insert like any text.  It is in points, measured from the left edge of the paper for the margin commands; one point is 1/72 inch.z18697jx1e12\29i1ILeft n to set the left margin to n points.  The default is 84.z18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U4i1I27i1IRight n to set the right margin to n points.  Use 530 to get a 1" margin.z18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U5i1I28i1IP n to set the left margin of the first line.  Use this to control indenting or un-indenting of the first line.  A Look Left cancels a Look P.z18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U1i1I110f1X n to set the space or leading between lines.  The leading should be at least 1 point (as it is in this document) to avoid a squashed effect.  If you want a less dense appearance, try larger leadings.z18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U1i1I21i7IE n to set the leading in front of the paragraph.z18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3\u1U1i1ITo find the horizontal position (in points) of a spot on the screen, say Look Where, put the tip of the cursor arrow at that spot, and click RED.  Look Here will give you the position of the start of the current selection.  The position appears on the left side of the system window, and you can use it as the argument of a Look command by simply typing ESC to the command when it asks you for the number.z18697jx1e12\f1 73u1U4u1U68u1U4u1UIf the current selection is a paragraph, Look Same will copy the paragraph looks of the paragraph in which the copy selection is made.  Otherwise, it copies text looks as described earlier.  In all the other cases, selecting any text within a paragraph is just as good as selecting the whole paragraph.z18697jx1e12You can select several paragraphs (using GREEN to extend your selection) and apply the same Look command to all of them.  You can change the looks of every paragraph in the document by doing an Everything to select the whole document before the Look.z18697jx1e12\41f1 5f0If you use several different formats (e.g., for section headings or for indented material) you can copy the formatting from an existing example of a particular style to a newly created one with Look Same.  Often it is convenient to put a set of sample paragraphs at the head of your document, each containing one line which explains what it is a sample of.  Then you can split the window (as described in the next section) and have the samples readily available to copy from with Look Same.z18697jx1e12When you are setting up the format for a document, you should put a few blank paragraphs (just CTRL-CRs) at the end, and set the formatting on all of them to your standard format (it is convenient to do this by copying the formatting from a paragraph which already has your standard format).  This might include indenting the first line of a paragraph, setting the leading, leaving space between paragraphs, justification, and even the font.  Now when you add material to the document by inserting into one of these blank paragraphs, you will automatically pick up all of the formatting you have preset.  As you type along, each time you use a CTRL-CR to start a new paragraph, it will acquire the same formatting as the old one.  It does not acquire the same character looks, however; those are all reset to the standard looks whenever you type a CTRL-CR.z18697jx1e12\95f1 7f0 542f1 7f0 197f1 7f03.3 Formatting stylez18697jx1e12\iThis section is intended to provide you with some guidance in using all the different ways Bravo gives you for controlling the appearance of your document.  Many of the rules are based on the customs of the printing industry.  There are two advantages to following these customs:z18697jx1e12they are the result of many years of experimentation, during which many people have tried to find out what looks good on the page;z18697l4268d4268p1jx1e3readers are accustomed to seeing text presented in this style.z18697l4268d4268p1jx4e3You will notice that some of the rules are contrary to the usual practice for preparing documents on a typewriter.  There are good reasons for this:  when you are printing with variable-pitch fonts, italics, boldface, justification and precisely controlled leading, some of the things which work well for fixed-pitch, single-font documents are no longer appropriate.z18697jx1e12EMPHASISz18697jx1e15\1f1Use italics for emphasis in text.  You can also use boldface, but this is usually less desirable, and it is better to reserve boldface for words which play some special role, e.g., begin and end in computer programs.  You should also use italics for the names of variables, e.g., "Suppose there are n items."z18697jx1e4\181b5B5b3B105i1IDon't use underlining for emphasis; it is not compatible with the use of italics and boldface.  Use underlining only when you want a different kind of emphasis, e.g., to distinguish the characters a user types from the ones the machine types, as is done in this document.z18697jx1e12\i5I138i4IDon't capitalize a whole word for emphasis.  In fact, try not to capitalize a whole word at all; it usually looks terrible in a variable-pitch font because the capital letters are so much wider than the small ones.  If you have words which you think should be set in capitals for some reason, try SMALL CAPITALS.  In this example, the S and C were 10 point (font 0), the rest of the letters 8 point (font 1).  Compare this with the appearance of FULLY CAPITALIZED words and you will see the point.z18697jx1e12\298f1 5f0 1f1 7f0SECTION HEADINGSz18697jx1e15\1f1 6f0 2f1In general, use left-justified rather than centered headings, and don't use all capitals, for the reasons just discussed.  Here is a satisfactory list of styles for the headings of successively larger portions of your document:z18697jx1e4smallest	Italic	20 pt paragraph leading (Look E 20)next	Bold	30 pt paragraph leadinglargest	12 pt bold	30 pt paragraph leadingz18697l4268d4268p1jx4e4For the largest units, you can center the heading and/or use all caps instead of, or as well as, switching to a 12 pt font.  It is best not to have more than three levels of heading, but you can extend to four or five levels using these tricks.  Helvetica 18 bold (font 9 bold) is sometimes nice for chapter or document titles.z18697jx1e4LEADINGz18697jx1e15\1f1The standard printing fonts are designed in such a way that they need some extra space between the lines to avoid a cramped appearance.  You put this space in with Look X, and you should use 1 pt for ordinary single-spaced text.  If you want a less dense appearance, experiment with more leading.z18697jx1e4Use double spacing (Look Ec) between paragraphs.  When you have indented material which is fairly short, try 4 pt leading, as in the example two paragraphs back.  Don't use extra  carriage rturns to get blank space between paragraphs.z18697jx1e12\26o3 1o0 136i5IINDENTINGz18697jx1e15\1f1Use Look Up and Look Down to indent material.  Note that this also works when you are typing in.  For example, if you typez18697jx1e4UcCRc Here are three points: CRcUcFirst ..CRcSecond ..CRcThird ..CRcDcNow we continue ...z18697jx1e4\1f1o4 1o0 2o4 1f0o0 24f1 2o4 1f0o0 1f1o4 1f0o0 8f1 2o4 1f0o0 9f1 2o4 1f0o0 8f1 2o4 1f0o0 1f1o4 1f0o0the document will look like this:z18697jx1e4Here are three points:z18697l4268d4268p1jx1e4First ..z18697l5538d5538p2jx1Second ..z18697l5538d5538p2jx1Third ..z18697l5538d5538p2jx1Now we can continue ..z18697l4268d4268p1jx1Use Look P if you want to indent the first line of a paragraph, rather than tabs.  When you have a list of items, it is often nice to unindent the first line by about 15 pts, especially if the items are numbered.  For example:z18697jx1e12\134i2I1. This paragraph was formatted with Look L 120, Look P 105, in order to make the number hang out to the left.z18697l4268d3704p1jx1e122. You can use Look Here to find out what the left margin of the paragraph is, if you have forgotten it.  Suppose it turns out to be 120, as in this example.z18697l4268d3704p1jx1e123. Then Look P 105 will make the first line of each paragraph hang out to the right by 15 points. z18697l4268d3704p1jx1e12OFFSETSz18697jx1e15\1f1Use the smallest offset you can get away with for subscripts and superscripts, since large offsets result in wide ugly spaces between the lines.  The offset used by Look ^ (superscript) and Look _ (subscript) can be defined in your user profile (see section 4.6); the standard user profile sets it to 4 pts.z18697jx1e43.4 Formsz18697jx1e20\iAlthough Bravo will let you start off with a completely empty window and start typing into it, this is a bad practice and should be avoided.  Instead, you should start out by Getting a template or form which will guide you in constructing the document you want.z18697jx1e12\185i8I4i4IAn obvious example is a memo form, and you find one on the file Form.Memo.  Start Bravo, and Get it into the window.  You will see that it has spaces for the sender, receiver, date and subject, and that these are filled in with words which indicate what should go there.  To fill in the form, select each of these words, and Replace it with the proper text.  Then do the same with the MEMOBODY.  When you are done, you have a completed memo which you can file under a suitable name using Put.z18697jx1e12Your disk comes equipped with a few forms; you can see their names by typing form.TAB to the Executive.  You should construct your own forms for other kinds of documents which you find yourself creating frequently.  As you have seen in the description of Bravo's formatting features above, a form can contain a great deal of information in addition to standard text and spaces to be filled in.  You will find that your life is easier and your work is more uniform and of higher quality if you use forms consistently, and take the trouble to carefully design a new one when necessary.z18697jx1e12\77u5f1o9 3f0o0U3.5 White spacez18697jx1e20\iWhen you type on a typewriter, you can get white space to appear between characters by typing spaces or TABs.  You can get blank lines by typing carriage returns.  In Bravo, you can do exactly the same things, with exactly the same results.  Space, TAB and CR are characters which are in your document exactly like "a", "b" or "c".  You can get Bravo to display them as special, visible characters by selecting the text in which you want to see them, and typingz18697jx1e12\104f1 4f0 141f1 3f0 5f1 2f0	Look visible		(this must be a lower-case v).z18697jx1\1u1U4u1UTo turn off the display and just see the usual white space, typez18697jx1	Look Visible	(this must be an upper-case V).z18697jx1\1u1U4u1UNormally you don't have to type any CRs; Bravo will automatically end a line when there is no room for the next word.  You can force a line to end by putting in a CR; this is appropriate when you want to control the layout of the text precisely, as in a table.  Otherwise, don't put in CRs.  You should use CTRL-CR to end a paragraph, as described in section 3.2.z18697jx1e12\36f1 3f0 124f1 2f0 121f1 3f0 18f1 7f0One difference between Bravo and ordinary typing is that a typewriter will allow you to set tab stops wherever you like.  Bravo, on the other hand, will only allow you to set them at equal intervals across the page (no claim is made that this is a good feature).  The normal tab stop settings for Bravo are every 60 points (a point is a unit of length used in the printing business; there are 72 points to the inch).z18697jx1e12You can change the distance between tab stops with the commandz18697jx1e12\f1Look TAB n  	(the TAB key, not the characters T A B)z18697l4268d4268p1jx1\f1u1U4u3U1ui1U8I4i24I5iwhere n is the desired distance, in points.  When you do this, Bravo will reformat your whole document, just as though you had typed it in with the new tab stop settings.  This is quite different from what happens on a typewriter, which obviously doesn't alter the appearance of anything you have already typed when you move tab stops. Two tiresome facts:z18697jx1\f1 6i1I67i8IBravo won't set more than 16 tab stops.z18697l4268d4268p1jx1\f1The current version of Bravo won't remember in the document that you changed the tab stops.  As a result, you (and anyone else who reads the document) will have to remember to make the change each time.  Conclusion: don't change the tab stops unless you really have to.  A future version of Bravo will correct this problem.  z18697l4268d4268p1jx1\f1The same reformatting happens whenever you make any change to the document:  Bravo will reformat the whole thing as though it had been retyped from the beginning.  This means that a TAB may go to a different tab stop than it did before.  You can see when this is happening, and correct for it by inserting an extra TAB or deleting one.z18697jx1e12\182f1 3f0 130f1 3f0Matters are complicated by the fact that Bravo normally formats the screen for easy readability, rather than exactly as it will appear when it is printed.  An unfortunate consequence of this is that the horizontal positioning of text is not necessarily the same on the screen as it is on the printed hardcopy (you can see this for yourself by typing in a few lines, printing the document, and comparing the hardcopy with the screen).  Since a TAB spaces from the current position to the next tab stop, where it spaces to will depend on the exact horizontal position of the TAB character.  This will usually be different between the screen and the hardcopy, except when the TABs are at the beginning of the line.z18697jx1e12\443f1 3f0 127f1 3f0 97f1 3f0Because of this problem, it is a good idea to do your editing of any text which has TABs within lines in hardcopy mode, in which Bravo will format the screen exactly like the hardcopy.  To get into hardcopy mode, give the commandz18697jx1e12\84f1 3f0 18i13ILook Magnify 1z18697l4268d4268p1jx1\u1U4u1U7uand to get out of it, the commandz18697jx1Look Magnify CLR (CLR is the blank key to the right of BS).z18697l4268d4268p1jx1\u1U4u1U7f1u3f0U2f1 3f0 34f1 2f0One final word about white space:  Bravo has formatting features, described in the section on paragraphs above, which allow you to indent the first line of a paragraph, and to put blank space above a paragraph, without using spaces, TABs or extra CRs.  It is good practice to use these features, since you can control the spacing much more precisely and don't have to worry about having extra characters cluttering up your document.z18697jx1e12\233f1 3f0 11f1 4f04. Other thingsz18697jx1e30\bIn this section you can learn about a wide variety of other useful things Bravo can do.  They are described more-or-less in order of cost-effectiveness: the earlier ones will probably give you more payoff per unit of effort to learn them.z18697jx1e124.1 Miscellaneous useful features z18697jx1e20\iThis section describes a number of features which are easy to learn and helpful to use.  As always, it is a good idea to try them out as you read about them.z18697jx1e12You can select entire lines of the document by moving the cursor into the line bar, which is to the left of the text area and to the right of the scroll bar.  You can tell that you are in the line bar because the cursor will appear as a right-pointing arrow when it is in the line bar.  To select the entire line pointed to by the cursor, use the RED mouse button.  To extend the selection, use the GREEN button.  Both of these work very much like selecting a character and extending.  The YELLOW button selects a paragraph; you can read about paragraphs in section 3.2.z18697jx1e12\74i8I265f1 3f0 49f1 5f0 86f1 6f0 18i9IYou can search the document for the next occurrence of some text with the `Jump command.  After you say Jump, you have to specify the text you want to search for, and you do this exactly the way you make an insertion:  by typing it in (ending with ESC), by making a copy selection, or by typing ESC to default to the same text which was used for the last Jump (not the last insertion or deletion).  Notice that if you type in text, it appears between the lower right-hand set of curly brackets in the system window; this is called the search key buffer, and it normally contains the last text you searched for.  The search starts with the second line displayed in the window.  If it succeeds, it brings the first occurrence of the text to the top of the window; if it fails, a note in the system window informs you.  Jump does not affect the current selection.z18697jx1e12\8i6I61u1U172f1 3f0 44f1 3f0 63i3I171i17IYou can substitute one text for another using the Substitute command.  It will ask you (in the top window) for the information it needs.  In looking for substitutions it will examine only the text in the current selection, so if you want to substitute throughout the document, do an Everything first; this will make the entire document the current selection.z18697jx1e12\8i10I32u1UTo put the current selection at the top of the screen, say Normalize.z18697jx1e12\59u1UTo insert the current date and time in front of the current selection, say Time.  Notice that it leaves just the time selected, so if you follow it immediately with a Delete, you will be left with just the date.  To replace some text with the current date, select it and say Delete Time Delete; be sure you understand why this works.z18697jx1e12\22i13I40u1UMost Bravo commands can be repeated by simply typing ESC in command mode.  When you do this, Bravo uses the current selection, not the one which the previous command used.  For example, you can append a carriage return after each of several words by selecting the first one and Appending after it, and then selecting successive words and simply typing ESC.  Or, you can search through the document looking for occurrences of a word by Jumping to it once and then just typing ESC.z18697jx1e12\27i8I18f1 3f0 52i7I237f1 3f0 120f1 3f0The Undo command will undo the action of most Bravo commands which change the document, provided you haven't moved the selection.  You can only Undo the most recent command; it will still work if you have scrolled, however.z18697jx1e12\4u1U17i4IThe ? command will split your bottom window in half and Get the file Bravo.Help into the bottom half.  You can put anything you want on this file; there is nothing special about it except that the ? command knows its name.  To get rid of the extra window, type Kill, move the cursor there, and hold down RED for about a second.z18697jx1e12\f1 4u1U256u1U4.2  Windowsz18697jx1e20\iSo far you have worked with a single document in a single window.  Bravo will let you work on several documents at the same time, each in its own window.  This is convenient if you want to compare two documents, or copy something from one into another, say from an address list into a letter.  You can also have several windows looking into the same document, which is nice when you want to copy something from one part of the document to another, or to check something on another page without losing your place.z18697jx1e12Some commands, like Jump and Everything, work on the current window, which is the window containing the current selection.z18697jx1e12\53i7IThere are two commands for windows, one for creating and re-arranging windows, and the other for destroying them.  Each has three options, selected by the three mouse buttons.z18697jx1e12To create a new window, type Window, move the cursor so that it marks the point where you want the new window boundary to be, and hold down GREEN.  The new window will appear.  As long as you keep GREEN down, you can move the cursor around and the top boundary of the new window will follow it.  When you let go of the button, the boundary will freeze.  Try it.  The new window will be empty, but you can insert or Get into it.z18697jx1e12\3i6I20u1U110f1 5f0 52f1 5f0To move a window boundary, type Window, put the cursor over the boundary you want to move, and hold down RED.  The boundary will follow the cursor until you let go of RED.z18697jx1e12\3i4I25u1U72f1 3f0 59f1 3f0To split a window, so that the same document appears in each of the two new windows, type Window, put the cursor where you want the split, and hold down YELLOW.  The new boundary will appear, and it will follow the cursor until you release YELLOW.  It is important to understand that after a split you have the same document in each window.  Scroll one of the windows so that some of the same text appears in both windows, and select some of the common text.  Notice that the selection appears in both windows.  If you make changes to the document, you will see them in both windows.  Each window is, quite literally, a window through which you can see a piece of the document.  This is very different from creating a new window and Getting the same file into it; that is equivalent to taking another copy out of a file cabinet.z18697jx1e12\3i5I82u1U62f1 6f0 81f1 6f0 65i4IYou can get rid of a window by typing Kill, putting the cursor in the doomed window, and holding down RED or GREEN for about a second.  RED will give the space of the window to the window above; GREEN will give it to the window below.  Kill YELLOW will clear the window; it is equivalent to Everything Delete.z18697jx1e12\38u1U63f1 3f0 4f1 5f0 22f1 3f0 56f1 5f0 36u1U4f1 6f0In summary:z18697jx1e12		Window		Killz18697jx1\2u1U7u1URED		move boundary	give space to window abovez18697jx1e12\f1 3f0YELLOW		split		clearz18697jx1\f1 6f0GREEN		new window	give space to windowz18697jx1\f1 5f0z18697jx14.3 If Bravo breaksz18697jx1e20\iWhen Bravo breaks or crashes, what usually happens is that Swat gets called; the manifestation is a couple of seconds of whirring from the disk, followed by a meaningless display on the screen, with the words Swat version xx at the top.  It this happens, look at the bottom of the screen to see whether there was a parity error.  If so, report it to Jim Cucinitti.  In any case, you should boot the machine.  Then, if you want to recover your work, you can proceed as described below.z18697jx1e12\21i7IBravo makes a record of everything you do during a session; the record is called the transcript.  It is useful for three reasons:z18697jx1e12\85i10IIf Bravo crashes because it has a bug, the transcript can be used to report the problem to the people responsible for fixing bugs.z18697l4268d4268p1je3If Bravo crashes because of a hardware failure of your Alto, a power failure, you accidentally pushing the boot button, or whatever, you can recover your work by replaying the transcript.  In this case, the last few characters you typed may be lost.z18697l4268d4268p1je3\162i9IIf you make a mistake, like deleting half of the document you have been editing for several hours, you can replay the transcript up to the error and then save the document.z18697l4268d4268p1je3You can do all these things using a system called BravoBug.  Thus,z18697jx1e12	>BravoBugCRz18697jx1\2u8f1o9will start replaying your transcript.  As the replay proceeds, Bravo will report each command, just as it does when you type a command in the usual way.  When it is finished, Bravo will say Ready, and you can go on editing.  It is a good idea to save your work with a Put and start Bravo again.z18697jx1To report a bug in Bravo and then do a replay, typez18697jx1e12\3i6I	>BravoBug/RCRz18697jx1\2u10f1o9This will send over to Maxc all the files involved in the bug, including the transcript, and then start Bravo to do the replay.z18697jx1You can control the replay, step by step, as described in this paragraph.z18697jx1e12To stop a replay which is going on, type a space.  As soon as the command currently being replayed is finished, Bravo will stop and tell you the number of the next command.  At this point you can typez18697l4268d4268p1jx1e12\145i6IQuick to make typed-in text go in all at once during the replay, rather than one character at a time.  This is faster, but you don't get to see what is going on.z18697l5538d5538p2je3\u1USlow to make typed-in text go in one character at a time.z18697l5538d5538p2je3\u1Uspace to replay one more command.  Note: only commands which change the text or windows are recorded in the transcript, not scrolling operations.z18697l5538d5538p2je3\u5UProceed to continue replaying at full speed.  You can stop the replay again at any point by typing a space.z18697l5538d5538p2je3\u1UBreak before command n to make the next Proceed stop before command n (of course, it will still stop right away if you type a space).  This is useful if you know that the first 50 commands are good, but want to proceed more cautiously after that.z18697l5538d5538p2je3\u1U20i1I46i1ITerminate CR to terminate the replay.  After terminating, you can proceed to give ordinary Bravo commands. Don't do this unless you are sure that you want to stop replaying.z18697l5538d5538p2je3\u1U9f1u2f0UYou should try replaying a Bravo session and using these commands, so that you feel comfortable with them.  You will then feel much more in control when you have a problem with Bravo or your Alto, or make a serious blunder while editing.z18697jx1e124.4  Arithmeticz18697jx1e20\iBravo incorporates a simple calculator, modeled after the Hewlett-Packard 35.  The calculator has a stack with room for four numbers; while you are using it the top of the stack is displayed in the search key buffer, in the lower right corner of the system window.z18697jx1e12\100i5ITo enter a number in your document onto the stack, select it and type `\.  To add a number in your document to the top of the stack, select it and type +.  Similarly, you can subtract with -, multiply with *, and divide with /.  After any of these operations, the top of stack is the current buffer, which means that you can insert its contents in a document by defaulting the text of the insertion with ESC.z18697jx1e12\71u1U80u1U36u1U16u1U18u1U178f1 3f0If you don't make a selection after giving one of these calculator commands, the next +, -, * or / will operate on the top two stack elements, rather than on the current selection and the stack.  Thus, to compute (a + b) * (c + d), youz18697jx1e12\214i1I3i1I5i1I3i1Iselect a     \ (enter)select b     +select c     \select d     +*z18697l5538d5538p2j\7i1I22i6I9i1I14i1IIf you want to type in a number instead of selecting it, give the # command, type the number, and end it with one of the calculator commands.  The number will appear just above the stack while it is being typed.z18697jx1e12\66u1UThere are two more calculator commands which are occasionally useful:z18697jx1e12_ exchanges the top two elements of the stackz18697l4268d4268p1je3^ rotates the stack, bringing the second element to the top and the top to the bottom.  Four repetitions of ^ leave the stack where it was.z18697l4268d4268p1je34.5  Other miscellaneous featuresz18697jx1e20\iBUFFERSz18697jx1e15\1f1The system window contains four pieces of text enclosed in curly brackets.  These are called buffers, and they are used for a variety of purposes, some of which you have already encountered.  The four buffers are numbered, as follows:z18697jx1e41 {last deletion}	2 {last insertion}3 {file name}		4 {search key}z18697l4268d4268p1jx4e4One of the buffers is always marked with a "*"; that one is the current buffer, and its contents are usually what is inserted when you just type ESC to default an insertion.  Commands which insert into buffers, like Jump and Get, default to the old contents of the buffer being loaded.z18697jx1e4\64i7I74f1 3f0The text in the buffers is always in visible mode, i.e., with spaces, TABs and CRs shown explicitly.  Furthermore, TABs and CRs don't have their usual effect of leaving white space or ending a line, because there is no room in the system window for these effects.  Finally, if there is too much text to fit in the space allowed for the buffer on the screen, the middle of the text is replaced by an ellipsis (...).z18697jx1e12\70f1 3f0 6f1 2f0 34f1 3f0 6f1 2f0You can force buffer n to be the current buffer by typing n ESC.z18697jx1e12\21i1I36u1U1f1u3f0ULOOK =z18697jx1e15\1f1 3f0iYou can set the amounts by which the margins are moved when you do a Look Up, by typingz18697jx1e4Look = l ESC r ESC p ESCz18697l4268d4268p1jx4e4\u1U4u1U1ui1UI1f1u3f0U1ui1UI1f1u3f0U1ui1UI1f1uHere l is the amount the left margin will be moved right, r the amount the right margin will be moved left, and p the amount the first line will be indented.  In all cases, the number is in points, and a negative number reverses the direction.  The default setting is 36, 0, 0.z18697jx1e4\5i1I52i1I53i1IPARTIAL SUBSTITUTIONz18697jx1e15\1f1 6f0 2f1If you want to substitute "that" for "this" you can use the Substitute command described in section 4.5.  If you want to change some of the occurrences of "this" to "that", however, it is useful to know about the Find and Yes commands.z18697jx1e4\128i4IFind is exactly like Jump, except thatz18697jx1e12\u1Uthe search starts from the end of the current selection, not from the second line of the display;z18697l4268d4268p1je3the occurrence of the key which is found becomes the current selection (Jump leaves the selection unchanged).z18697l4268d4268p1je3Yes is equivalent to Replace ESC Find ESC.  So, to change some "this"es to "that"s, proceed as follows:z18697jx1e12\u1U20u1U7f1u3f0U1u1U4f1u3f0Uselect something before the first place you want to start looking;z18697l4268d4268p1je3Find this ESC;z18697l4268d4268p1je3\u1U4u4U1f1uESC to repeat the Find until you get the one you want to change;z18697l4268d4268p1je3\f1u3f0UReplace that ESC;z18697l4268d4268p1je3\u1U7u4U1f1u3f0UFind ESC;z18697l4268d4268p1je3\u1U4f1u3f0UNow at each point type ESC (i.e., repeat the Find) to make no change and go on to the next "this", or Yes to make the same change you made last time and then go on.z18697l4268d4268p1je3\23f1u3f0U76u1UMAGNIFICATIONz18697jx1e15\1f1You have already learned about Look Magnify 1.  Actually, you can type other digits instead of 1 and get into hardcopy mode with other magnifications of the printed text on the screen:z18697jx1e48		screen is 80% the size of the hardcopy9		90%0		100%1		110% (hardcopy just fits with a right margin of 530)2		120%3		130%4		140%CLR	turns off hardcopy modez18697l4268d4268p1je4\137f1 3f0At the larger magnifications there won't be room on the screen for all of the page unless the right margin is less than 530, and the excess will be chopped off on the right.  This makes magnifications greater than 110% relatively useless.z18697jx1e4Depending on the magnification, Bravo will choose an appropriately sized screen font from the list provided in your user profile (see the next section) to represent each of your hardcopy fonts.  There is no guarantee that a screen font will exist which is closely matched to the hardcopy font at the magnification you are using.  In order to make the screen faithful to the hardcopy, Bravo forces the two ends of each line, and the tab stops, to fall in the right places, and makes up for the discrepancies by adjusting the spaces between words.  If the screen font is much too big (as it is likely to be at small magnifications), this adjustment may be so large that words overlap.  The only remedy for this is to change to a larger magnification, or find a smaller screen font.  If a line is very short, you can often eliminate the overlap by adding a couple of spaces to the end of the line.z18697jx1e12CONTROL CHARACTERSz18697jx1e12\1f1 6f0 2f1Note: this section is mostly for programmers.z18697jx1e12\iBravo normally displays a control character as the corresponding lower-case letter (or whatever) with an overbar.  If you turn on Look Graphic it will try to display the control character from the font (if there is something in the font for it).  This is a character Look, just like Look Visible.z18697jx1e12You can't type a control character in directly, but you can type the corresponding regular character, followed by a Sc, which converts the preceding regular character into a control character.z18697jx1e12\102i8I7f1o4 1o0 1f04.6  The user profilez18697jx1e20\iThe file User.cm is your user profile, which contains information for various systems about how you want them to be set up for your use.  The information for each system starts with the name of the system in brackets, e.g. [BRAVO].  The n follow a series of lines of the formz18697jx1e12\25i12Ilabel: informationz18697l4268d4268p1jx1Bravo currently accepts three kinds of information in the user profile:  initial and quit macros, described in the next section, and font definitions and default parameter settings, which are discussed here.  Look at your User.cm file now, to see how this works.z18697jx1\90i6IEach line of font definition tellsz18697jx1e12the number of the font (0 to 9)z18697l4268d4268p1je3\4i6Ithe name and size (in points) of the hardcopy fontz18697l4268d4268p1je3\4i4I5i4Ithe name and size of one or more screen fonts which can be used to represent that hardcopy font on the screen.  Bravo will choose the most suitable font from this list, based on the current magnification.z18697l4268d4268p1je3For example, the linez18697jx1e12	FONT:0 TIMESROMAN 10 TIMESROMAN 12 TIMESROMAN 10z18697jx1says that font 0 is to print as 10 pt Times Roman.  The font will be represented on your disk by a file called TimesRoman10.ep; the "ep" is the extension for hardcopy fonts.  There will also be files called TimesRoman10i.ep and TimesRoman10b.ep for the italic and bold versions of the font, if you expect to use those.z18697jx1The rest of the line says that font 0 can be represented on the screen by the screen fonts stored on files TimesRoman12.al and TimesRoman10.al can be used to represent font 0.  Bravo will use the 12 pt version in display mode, and the 10 pt version if the magnification is 110% or less.  The extension "al" is used for screen fonts.  There are no files for the bold or italic versions of screen fonts, because Bravo can construct them from the regular version.z18697jx1e12In addition to all these .ep and .al files, there is also a file called FontWidths.b which contains information about the widths of all the characters in the hardcopy fonts.z18697jx1e12Current versions of all the Parc fonts are stored on the Maxc directories <Fonts> and <Altofonts>.  If you obtain new hardcopy fonts from these directories, you should also get yourself a new version of <Fonts>FontWidths.b.z18697jx1e12The user profile also contains settings for the default margins, tab interval, and Look = parameters.  You can change them by editing User.cm in a way which should be obvious.z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12z18697jx1e12

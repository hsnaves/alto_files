Type SubsystemCopyright Xerox Corporation 1979Type.run ( on MAXC<ALTO> ) is a small program for useinstead of "type.~" in the executive.  It accepts a stringof file name(s) in the command line, ie. "type foo foo1 etc".It opens the files and displays their contents "page" at a time.The Bravo formatting information (all characters betweenCont Z and the next carrage return) are suppressed.The program recognises the following "global" switches:	Type/N Substitutes "N" spaces ( 0 through 9) each	time the program encounters a "tab" character.	Type/Z Does not supress Bravo format information	and displays all characters	Type/L Lists the decimal line count as determined by	counting carrage return characters.	Type/C Lists the octal character count of thefirst character in the line.The program recognises the following keyboard input:	"^" backs up to the last "page" displayed.	"ESC" skips to the start of the next file.	"DEL" or "^C" returns to the executive.	Any other character will display the next "page" of the file.Roger Bates

HARDCOPY SUBSYSTEMCopyright Xerox Corporation 1979HardCopy is a program for automatically invoking the Bravo "hardcopy" command from the Altoexecutive. It also calls FTP if necessary to retrieve files from a shared file server such as Maxc orIvy.  It also prints press files by invoking Empress.  This subsystem saves keystrokes and yourconcentration, but not clock time.How to use it...You can say to the Alto Executive:	> HardCopy file-descriptor file-descriptor ...where a file-descriptor has the usual format:	[host]<directory>fileName.extensionAll fields are optional, except fileName.  If ".extension" is omitted, a default is taken from theuser.cm file.  If "[host]" is omitted, HardCopy looks first on the local Alto disk; if the file is notthere, it takes a default remote host from the user.cm file.  Once a "host" or "directory" appears onthe command line, it remains in effect along the line until overriden by another.  Version numbersand sub-directories can be used when contacting servers that support these features.For multiple copies, attach a switch to a file-descriptor; for example "HardCopy someFile.bravo/3",produces three copies.  The copy quantity remains in effect along the command line until overridenby another.Ordinarily, the printer used is the one appearing in user.cm.  This can be overriden using the "p"switch.  For example: "HardCopy Menlo/p [Iris]<dir>sub>someFile.bravo".  The printerdesignation remains in effect along the command line until overriden by another.Press files are recognized by the extension "press", and are handed to Empress instead of to Bravo. Ceretain other extensions (unformatted text files produced by commonly used subsystems) aretreated in the same way; e.g., "typescript", "mail", and "tty".A temporary file HardCopy.scratch$ is created and deleted if a file is retrieved from a server.You need the proper fonts, and Bravo 6.0 or later.Name completion and "*" substitution work for local files only.How to obtain it...1. Using the FTP "load" command, fetch the file hardcopy.dm.  This includes two files:HardCopy.run and UserCm.slice.2.  UserCm.slice contains two parts: a Bravo H.INIT macro and a sample "HardCopy" section. Edit the first part into the bravo portion of your user.cm file.  Make the second the "HardCopy"portion of user.cm, after replacing the host name and the extension with your favorite ones (theextension must include the leading dot). Don't forget to "Bravo/I".

PRELIMINARY PROM MANUAL (June 8, 1977  4:19 PM)PROM is a program to drive the Alto Prom Blower. PROM combines the features of APROM, PROMDIAG, and LOGICPROM. PROM supersedes all previous prom blowing software for the Alto Prom Blower and is the ONLY software package that will be supported for use with the Prom Blower. PROM runs in three modes, "MB File" mode which corresponds fairly closely to APROM, "MB File" mode which corresponds fairly closely to PROMDIAG, and "MB File" mode which corresponds fairly closely to LOGICPROM.e12(635)PROM COMMAND LINEe72cGLOBAL SWITCHESe12	none			Select "MB File" mode.	/E				Select "Prom Editor" mode	/D				Select "Prom Blower Diagnostic" mode	/S				Call Swat (debug use only)e12LOCAL SWITCHES (valid in "MB File" mode only)e12	string/P	Permutate address (Default 9876543210)	name/F		Read micro binary from file "name"	name/D		Write differences on file "name"	name/M		Use memory "name"	number/C	Chip starting address equals "number"	number/B	Set chip starting bit equal to "number"	number/A	Set memory starting address to "number"	number/S	Set memory starting bit to "number" blow the					prom.e12PROM EDITOR COMMANDSe12cCOMMAND				ACTION	Q				Quit	Z				Zero prom	I				Invert Prom	S				Set prom to all ones	C				Change prom (alters bits pointed to by mouse;					red sets bit, yellow resets bit, blue returns					control to keyboard input)	R				Reverse bit (data bits are numbered with bit					zero starting from the left)	E				Equation ("or" the equation into the bit 					selected.

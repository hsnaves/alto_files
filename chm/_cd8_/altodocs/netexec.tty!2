                           Network ExecutiveNetExec is  an Alto command  processor for invoking  certain subsystemsvia  the Ethernet  without  using the  local  disk.  It  is  useful forrebuilding a smashed disk and for loading diagnostic programs  when thedisk  is sick.   Its  user interface  is intentionally  similar  to thestandard Alto Executive.The program is invoked by holding down the <backspace> and <quote> keyswhile pressing  the boot button.   You must continue  to hold  the keysdown until a small square appears in the middle of the screen, then youcan let go.  NetExec  and all of the  programs invoked by it  are boot-format files  kept by  'boot-servers' --  programs which  implement theAlto boot  protocol.  Most  gateways and some  other programs  (such asPeek) contain boot-servers.When the NetExec  arrives, it displays a  ">" and blinks its  cursor toindicate that it is ready for commands from the user.  In parallel withthis it displays a  pair of lines near the  top of the screen  with itsname  and   version  number,  a   digital  clock,  and   the  machine'sinternetwork address.Typing "?" causes  the NetExec to display  a list of the  boot-files itknows how to invoke.  NetExec  builds this list by probing  the networkfor boot servers  and asking them what  boot files they are  willing togive out.  There are also  some built-in functions which are  listed by"?" as if they were boot files:     BootDP0       Causes NetExec to  boot the operating system  on DP0                   of the current partition.     FileStat      Prompts you for a  boot file name and tells  you all                   about it: its boot file number, the host  from which                   the NetExec will obtain it, and the  key combination                   which will boot it directly.     Partition     prompts you  for a disk  partition number.   If this                   number is zero,  NetExec tells you the  current disk                   partition.  If  it is non-zero,  it attempts  to set                   the partition to that number.  This command  is only                   available  on  machines that  support  multiple disk                   partitions: Dorados and D0s.     Probe         Causes NetExec to probe the network looking for boot                   servers.  If it discovers any new ones, it  will add                   the new boot files  to its list.  This is  done once                   automatically when NetExec starts, and  whenever the                   user types an unrecognized command.     Quit          Boots DMT     SetTime       Causes NetExec  to probe the  network looking  for a                   time  server.

This   is   done  once                   automatically when NetExec starts.In  the future,  common  subsytems should  be  stored in  a  few placesthroughout the network, not on every local disk; perhaps the local diskcan  be  eliminated  entirely.    Doing  so  requires  a   much  betterintegration of  network and  OS facilites  than currently  exists.  TheNetExec described here is not  intended to do this.  There  are severallimitations in the current implementation:     1)  Most  boot-files  are  quite  large.   Typical boot-         servers have  space for only  the few  most commonly         used programs.     2)  Boot-servers  typically  run in  machines  with some         other primary  purpose, such  as gateways,  and must         not  consume  too  many  resources.   As  a  result,         booting is slow and  only one machine can  be served         at a time.

                                 RDictRDict is a stripped-down version of PrePress, produced by  Lyle Ramshaw(PARC, CSL) in late 1979 for the special purpose of rotating all of thefonts in a large dictionary.  Suppose that you are the proud owner of adictionary of  orbitized rasters,  say the  Spruce.Fonts of  your localDover printer.  You would like to produce a new dictionary of orbitizedrasters, in which each font has been rotated through 90 degrees.  To dothis job with PrePress, you would have to Extract,  DeOrbitize, Rotate,Orbitize,  and  then  Merge each  font  individually.   With  the RDictprogram,  you can  eliminate  the Extract  and Merge  portions  of thisscenario, and save  yourself the production of  a large sea  of commandlines as well.The input to  RDict is a  dictionary of rasters,  all of which  must beeither of type OrbitChars or type MultiChars.  RDict will  simply throwaway the extra width  information included in the  MultiChars segments,and produce an  output dictionary in which  all of the segments  are oftype OrbitChars.RDict is controlled via the command line.  Invoke RDict by saying            RDict <InputFileName> <Angle> <OutputFileName>where  the  three  parameters  are as  follows.   If  you  have troubleremembering the order of the three arguments, you may invoke RDict withthe  command line  "RDict", and  it  will prompt  you for  each  of thearguments in turn.The <InputFileName> is  a regular file  name, optionally preceded  by adisk specifier.  To  refer to a file  on the standard system  disk, youmay use  the disk  specifier "dp0:",  or just  omit the  disk specifierentirely.  Upper and lower  case are equivalent in disk  specifiers, so"DP0:" or  "Dp0:" or  "dP0:" mean  the same  as "dp0:".   The specifier"dp1:" refers to the other  Diablo Model 31 drive, should your  Alto beso equipped.   Trident T-80  drives are referred  to as  "tp0:" through"tp7:".  Trident  T-300 drives  contain up  to three  entirely distinctAlto file systems; the three file systems on physical T-300 drive 3 arereferred  to as  "tp3:", "tp403:",  and "tp1003:"  (for  arcane reasonsthat, if you have a T-300, you probably already know).The <OutputFileName>  is a  regular file name  preceded by  an optionaldisk specifier  in an  analogous fashion.  If  the output  file alreadyexists, RDict will overwrite it.The <Angle> field specifies  the amount of additional rotation  that isdesired, as  a signed,  decimal quantity  expressed in  degrees (ratherthan  minutes).  The  <Angle>  must be  a  multiple of  90  degrees, ofcourse.   The  rotation  specified  by  <Angle>  is   incremental,  notabsolute.  For example, suppose that  you use RDict to rotate  an inputdictionary  by 90  degrees; a  font in  the input  whose Rotation  is xminutes  of arc  will be  written into  the output  with a  Rotation of(x+5400) minutes, since 5400 minutes is 90 degrees.                             ------------                   Copyright Xerox Corporation 1979RDict                      January 10, 1980                           2RDict first scans the input file, and prints out for you how many fontsof what types it contains, pausing  for 5 seconds to let you  read thisdisplay.  Next, RDict writes a blank output file of roughly the correcttotal length.  This guarantees that the disk containing the output filewill overflow right away if it will overflow at all, instead of waitinguntil the program has run for several hours.  Having written this blankoutput file, RDict next writes  at the beginning of that output  file aPrePress-style index that describes  the desired output fonts;  one bitin each  index entry,  however, specifies  that the  corresponding fontdata has not  yet been rotated.  Then,  RDict takes each font  in turn,and, for each character in that font, calls the standard  PrePress codeto DeOrbitize, Rotate, and then Orbitize that character.   [RDict couldbe made to run more rapidly if a special Rotate were written  that wentfrom OrbitChars to OrbitChars directly; but I'm lazy, and I didn't wantto introduce any new bugs in the rasters themselves.] When  the rotatedfont  data  has  been  completely  entered  in  the  output  file,  thecorresponding index entry is changed to mark that font as processed.Since RDict runs tend to take a long time, there is a  high probabilitythat you might want to interrupt one someday. Once the output  file hasbeen  set  up,  and  actual rotations  of  fonts  have  begun,  you mayinterrupt RDict at any time by merely typing <shift>-<swat>.  To resumethe computation at  some later time,  repeat the earlier  command line,except type  "RDict/R" instead  of simply "RDict"  (the "R"  stands for"Restart").  RDict will  scan the input and  output files to  check forconsistency, and then resume processing by starting to rotate the firstfont that is not yet marked as complete.Note that RDict can be used to throw away all but the most recent widthinformation  in the  MultiChars fonts  of a  dictionary,  without doinganything  else.   To  convert  all  of  the  MultiChars  segments  in adictionary to the equivalent  OrbitChars segments, just run  RDict overthe dictionary  and specify "0"  as the <Angle>.   To make this  use ofRDict more convenient, the program makes a special check for an <Angle>of 0, and, in this case, simply copies each character from the input tothe  output,  without  bothering to  DeOrbitize,  Rotate  by  zero, andOrbitize again.RDict is unforgiving about errors,  and solves most of its  problems bycalling Swat with some  flavor of message.  Errors generated  inside ofthe code that Rotates, Orbitizes, and DeOrbitizes will also  call Swat.For example, I hit  a "Character height inconsistancy" after  more thanfour hours of rotating my Spruce.Fonts: life is hard.

           For Xerox Internal Use Only -- September 7, 1976For PARC Alto Users        September 7, 1976                          11. PARC Information1.1. Getting StartedNew Alto disks are stored in a cabinet in the Maxc room.  Please recordthe serial number  of any new  disk that you take  on the log  which isattached to the front to the cabinet..The  BASIC ALTO  DISK is  in a  rack near  the Alto  in the  Maxc room.Procedures  for  copying the  Basic  Alto  Disk to  your  new  disk aredescribed  in section  6  of the  Operating  System Manual  and  in theCopyDisk document.1.2. Alto DirectoriesThe <ALTODOCS> directory contains documentation for the  subsystems andsubroutine packages.The  <ALTO>  directory  contains  current  versions  of  all  the  Altoprograms.   Programs are  normally kept  in executable  form;  thus theCopyDisk  program appears  as <ALTO>CopyDisk.Run.   In addition  to theexecutable file, some programs also have a symbol file on  <ALTO>.  Thesymbol file name has the  extension .Syms.  This file is useful  to theauthor  when something  goes  wrong with  a  subsystem, but  it  is notnormally needed by  users.  Subsystems which  need more than  one file,either  because they  have overlays  or because  they need  data files,should have the individual  files stored, together with a  command filewhich  may be  run to  retrieve each  file via  FTP.  The  command fileshould have the extension .CM.  Definition files have the extension .D.These files are useful only to programmers.Subroutine packages are kept on <ALTO> with an extension of .BR.The <ALTOSOURCE> directory contains the source files for the subsystemsand  subroutine  packages.  It  also  contains the  PUB  files  for thedocumentation which is on <ALTODOCS>.1.3. Alto Software ReleasesThe maintainer of  a subsystem or subroutine  package handles a  new orrevised release in the following manner:A.  Copy a dump file with  a name of the form subsystemname.DM  and thefollowing contents to <ALTOSOURCE>:      1) The source files from which the subsystem may be created.      2) The  command files  which are needed  to create  the subsystem      from  the   enclosed  source.   The   following  are   the  usual      requirements:            a)  A command  file  containing statements  to  compile the            enclosed source.  Compiler messages should be written  to a            file.  For example:            BCPL/F FOO.BCPL.           For Xerox Internal Use Only -- September 7, 1976For PARC Alto Users        September 7, 1976                          2            The filename should be in the format, COMPILEsubsysname.CM.            b) A command file  containing statements to load  the files            which were produced in step a.  For example:            BLDR FOO            The filename should be in the format, LOADsubsysname.CM.                  If the subsystem is small, the two command  files may                  be  combined into  one.  The  name should  be  in the                  format,  CREATEsubsysname.CM.  The  following example                  will create the package for subsystem, FOO.                  BCPL/F FOO.BCPL                  BLDR FOO            c) A command  file containing statements save  all relevant            files  in  subsysname.DM, e.g.  the  file  DUMPFOO.CM would            contain;            DUMP FOO.DM FOO.BCPL CREATEFOO.CM DUMPFOO.CMB.   When  you have  a  change to  make  to documentation,  or  wish tointroduce new documentation into the system, the following  three stepsare required:      1. Retrieve the relevant  .PUB file from <ALTOSOURCE>.   The filename  is  in  the format,  sys.PUB,  where  'sys' is  the  name  of thesubsystem  or  subroutine  package.   If  you  are  creating  brand newdocumentation,  see  the  file  <ALTOSOURCE>ALTODOCTEMPLATE.PUB  for anexample.      2. Edit the  pub file.  Pass  it to PUB--  a .TTY version  of thedocumentation will be produced.      3. When you are finished, copy the pub file back to <ALTOSOURCE>,and copy the .TTY version to <ALTODOCS>.Please be sure to copy the pub files from <ALTOSOURCE> afresh each timeyou edit them, because they may have been edited to  produce expurgatedversions (for  distribution outside PARC),  to produce  indexes, remedyformatting problems, etc.Please try  to avoid  needless references to  PARC or  Maxc facilities.For example, it  is frowned upon to  mention the <ALTO> directory  as aplace to find  something.  That is  assumed for PARC  users. Similarly,avoid needless references to GEARS or EARS.C.  Copy files  needed for the new  release to <ALTO>.   After updatingfiles   on   <ALTO>,   you   should   run   the   MAXC   command   file<ALTO>ALTOMAINT.CMD    to   delete    excess   verisons    and   update<ALTOSOURCE>MAXLOG,  the  file  used  by  the  UPDATE  procedure.   Forexample:            @CONNECT ALTO ISFWGI            @COPY <SPROULL>CHAT.RUN CHAT.RUN            @COPY <SPROULL>CHAT.SYMS CHAT.SYMS            @RUNFIL ALTOMAINT.CMD           For Xerox Internal Use Only -- September 7, 1976For PARC Alto Users        September 7, 1976                          3            @CONNECTD.  Send a message to  Alto users describing the changes which  will beeffective with this  release.  The list of  Alto users is on  the file,<SECRETARY>ALTOUSERS.MSG.   The subject  of the  message should  be thename of the  subsystem or subroutine package.  Try to keep  the messageshort.Passwords:  The password  to all  Alto-related directories  on  MAXC isISFWGI.  Software  maintainers are  cautioned to  alter only  files forwhich  they  will  take  responsibility.   Feel  free  to  archive  oldversions, but please leave the current version of all files.1.4. Alto DocumentationFormal documentation is provided in two forms: a "perusal"  form, whichcan be conveniently typed  at a TI or  VTS terminal on Maxc  or perusedwith Bravo on an Alto, and a "notebook" form, which can only be printedon ears,  and may have  fancy illustrations or  fonts in  it.  Informal"message"  documentation can  be extracted  from  the <ALTO>MESSAGE.TXTfile.A. The "perusal" documentation  is always stored on <ALTODOCS>  under afile name  like sys.TTY,  where "sys" is  the name  of the  subystem orpackage you are  interested in.  For  example, the documentation  for asubroutine package, FOO, would be found on <ALTODOCS>FOO.TTY.  There isone exception to this rule: for very simple subsystems (e.g.,  DUMP andLOAD), the documentation is in <ALTODOCS>SMALLSUBSYSTEMS.TTY.B.  The  "notebook" documentation  is  packaged in  larger  packages toreduce  storage  overhead  and  to  provide  more  manageable  sets  ofdocumentation  for  printing.    Currently,  the  following   files  on<ALTODOCS> may be copied to lpt: for notebook-style documentation:      NPALTO.EARS.  "The Non-Programmer's Guide to the Alto."      BRAVO.EARS,  MARKUP.EARS, DRAW.EARS  (etc),  NSIL.EARS, SIL.EARS,            GYPSY.EARS.   Currently,  these subsystems  have  their own            separate ears documentation.      OS.EARS.  Operating System manual.      BCPL.EARS.  A new, revised BCPL manual.      SUBSYSTEMS.EARS.  Documentation for most Alto  subsystems (except            those  listed below).   These are  arranged alphabetically,            with headings to indicate which system is  being described.            A directory at the front of the file contains documentation            about  very simple  subsystems.  The  last section  of this            manual contains  special information  relating to  Altos at            PARC--where to find the software, how to maintain it, etc.      PACKAGES.EARS.   This  contains  documentation  for  the software            packages available for the Alto.      ALTOHARDWARE.EARS.  This is  the "hardware" manual for  the Alto.            The Trident disk interface is described in TRIDENT.EARS.These files are formatted, and should therefore be printed with           For Xerox Internal Use Only -- September 7, 1976For PARC Alto Users        September 7, 1976                          4      @COPY FOO.x LPT: [confirm] ('x' is either TTY or EARS)To print all the short documents on EARS, you can just say      @COPY <ALTODOCS>*.TTY LPT:DEFONT.EP crThe  "notebook" documentation  for  all the  subsystems  and subroutinepackages may be obtained by:      @COPY <ALTODOCS>SUBSYSTEMS.EARS to LPT: [confirm]      @COPY <ALTODOCS>PACKAGES.EARS to LPT: [confirm]C. The file <ALTO>MESSAGE.TXT contains all of the information which hasbeen sent to Alto users with SNDMSG.  Information about  recent changesto a specific subsystem may  be selected by using the  'subject string'option of the MSG subsystem.  For example, you may type      MSG <ALTO>MESSAGE.TXT T S FOOOr you can read the entire file by saying      File: <ALTO>MESSAGE.TXTto READMAIL.   Every six months  this file will  be purged and  its oldcontents left on the next version of OLDMESSAGE.TXT.1.5. Obscure <ALTO> facilitiesIn  addition to  the subsystems,  packages, and  definition  files, thefollowing occasionally needed (somewhat obscure) files may be  found onthe <ALTO> directory:      ALTOMAINT.CMD: a maxc command  file to be run each  time anything      new is copied onto the <ALTO> directory.      FORM.DM: a dump file containing standard forms in BRAVO format.      NEWDISK.CM: a command file for creating a minimal system on a new      disk.   (See  the  Newdisk  procedure,  documented  in  the  Alto      Subsystems manual.)      NPDISK.CM: the Non-Programmer's supplement to NEWDISK.CM.      PDISK.CM: the Programmer's supplement to NEWDISK.CM.      STATUS.LOG: a file identifying the author, type, and distribution      status of all Alto software.1.6. MiscellaneousThe  Operating  System was  designed  by Butler  Lampson  and initiallyimplemented by  Gene McDaniel.   It is  currently being  maintained andextended by Butler Lampson and Bob Sproull.e12

0 Sys.errors -- OS error string file.  Copyright Xerox Corporation 1979, 1980, 1981  Last modified November 26, 1981  12:04 PM by Taft$$1000M The program being run encountered stack overflow.This causes a trap to the Swat debugger.$$1001M The program you are running has tried to use an incompletelyimplemented structure reference in BCPL.  (The most common cause of this error is to use bit arrays (only byte and word arrays work).)$$1002M Dvec overflowed the stack while attempting to assign a blockof $1D words.$$1003M A procedure that uses DefaultArgs was called with too few arguments.$$1101M The disk routines have encountered an unrecoverable disk error.Stream = $1O; disk command block = $2O;command = $2!2O; real disk address = $2!11O; status = $2!1O.You should try running the SCAVENGER on your disk; it may be able todiagnose or correct the problem.$$1102C Your machine's disk is full.  You should either boot the machine,or type <control>K to kill the current program.  In any event, you shoulddelete some unneeded files before attempting any more operations.$$1103 Bad action $1O passed to BfsDoDiskCommand.$$1104 Control Block queue inconsistancy detected in BfsGetCb.$$1105 Attempt to create file on disk with no creation ability.$$1106 Can't create essential file during BFSNewDisk.$$1107 Disk bit table discrepancy during BFSNewDisk.$$1108 Attempt to access nonexistant Diablo disk bit table page $1O.$$1200 Stream access error.  Stream is $1O.$$1201 Stream error: attempt to use a word-transfer operation (ReadBlock orWriteBlock) when the stream is not positioned on a word boundary.The stream is $1O.$$1202M Stream error: argument to PositionPtr is outside the allowablerange for a page of bytes (Diablo: 512, Trident: 2048).  Stream is $1O.$$1203M Stream error: a disk-stream function has been called with a"stream" argument that does not appear to be a valid disk stream.The questionable stream pointer is $1O.$$1204M Stream error: a bug has been encountered in the disk stream codein the operating system.$$1205M Stream error: insufficient free space is available to allocatethe stream data structure and the disk buffer.  This is usually the resultof trying to open too many streams concurrently.$$1301 Fast stream error: the "item size" (measured in bytes) is neither1 nor 2. Stream is $1O.$$1302 Fast stream error: trying to read or write beyond end of file.The stream is $1O.$$1303M Fast stream error: trying to call a generic stream operation(e.g., Resets) that is unimplemented for this particular stream.Stream is $1O.$$1501 Directory error: the directory being read (stream = $1O;word position = $2Ob) has a malformed entry in it.Proceeding is probably useless.  Consider running the Scavenger.$$1502M Directory error: the directory being read (stream = $1O;word position = $2Ob) has an entry with an unknown type field (DV.type).No present program knowingly writes such things in the directory,so you probably have a smashed directory.Consider running the Scavenger.$$1503M Directory error: the directory specified as the "current"directory (its name appears to be: "$1S") cannot be read.$$1504M Directory error: file name too long.$$1505M Open error: a file that appears to be mentioned in yourdirectory cannot be opened.  This may mean that the directory orthe file is smashed.  Consider running the Scavenger.$$1600M Stream error: insufficient free space exists in which toallocate a stream data structure.  The size required is $1D. words.$$1700M Display stream error: insufficient bit map region has beensupplied.  Stream is $1O.$$1701M Display stream error: the call to open the stream specifiesthat the system font should be used, but it does not exist(probably because a Junta has removed it).  Stream is $1O.$$1801M Alloc error: An allocation request cannot be met becausethe zone is out of space!$$1802M Alloc error: an region of core presented to AddToZone orInitializeZone is either too small (less than the minimum neededfor the zone data structure) or too large (more than 32K-1 words).$$1803M Alloc error: trying to free a block that does not appearto have been allocated.  Another possible explanation is thatthe block's boundary tags have been smashed.$$1804M Alloc error: A storage zone is malformed.More detailed information can be extracted by looking to seeexactly which error check called this error routine.$$1805 Alloc error: a size request to Allocate is unreasonably large(it may be a negative number!)$$1960M CallSubSys error: Are you sure this is a ".run" file?Start of statics = $2O must be GE userBottom = $1O.Start of statics must be LE end of statics = $3O.End of Statics must be LE userTop = $40.$$1961M CallSubSys error: Are you sure this is a ".run" file?Start of code = $2O must be GE userBottom = $1O.Start of code must be LE end of code + relPairs = $3O.End of code + relPairs must be LE userTop = $4O.$$1962 The system cannot find a file called "Executive.Run" to run!Suggest you etherBoot FTP, and retrieve Executive.run.$$1963 Junta: the level name you are asking me to junta back to ($1D.)does not exist!  Type <ctrl>K to kill; do not continue!$$1965M CallSubSys error: Are you sure this is a ".run" file?The length of the file does not agree with BLDR's layout vector.$$1966 Junta: A Junta will not work correctly until you haveinstalled the operating system.$$2100 BTree: RecordGenerator returned record with wrong key.  (Tree = $1O)$$2101 BTree: Right father doesn't point to right brother.  (Tree = $1O)$$2102 BTree: DepositESL wrote wrong number of words.  (Tree = $1O)$$2103 BTree: Entry list has too few elements.  (Tree = $1O)$$2104 BTree: WritePage wrote wrong number of words.  (Tree = $1O)$$2105 BTree: Two brothers not enough.  (Tree = $1O)$$2106 BTree: New root page overflowed.  (Tree = $1O)$$2107 BTree check error: record counts disagree.  (Tree = $1O)$$2108 BTree check error: records out of order.  (PathStk = $1O)$$2200 PupBSP: Gets failed because the connection is no longer open.$$2201 PupBSP: Gets failed because no data became available for readingwithin the specified timeout.$$2202 PupBSP: Gets failed because it encountered a Mark in the stream.$$2203 PupBSP: Puts failed because the connection is no longer open.$$2204 PupBSP: Puts failed because it was not possible to output the bytewithin the specified timeout.$$2205 PupBSP: Executed BSPGetMark when no Mark was pending.$$2220 PupLevel1: CloseLevel1Socket: Nonexistent socket (not on socketQ).$$2221 PupLevel1: SetAllocation: Called with "total" smaller than"input" or "output".$$2222 PupLevel1: This machine has no network interfaces at all!How do you expect to communicate?.$$2223 PupRoute: The routing table is full.  This can happen only if youare running obsolete versions of Pup software.  Get a new version of whateveryou were running.$$2230 PupEther: This machine has no Ethernet interface!$$2231 PupEther: Impossible Ethernet interface status.Consider calling a repairman.$$2232 PupEther: This machine must have a non-zero host address before anynetwork software will work.  The host address is set by jumpers on thebackplane.$$2240 PupRTP: Socket has improper RTP state for a locally-generated event(should never happen unless there is a bug in the RTP module or you havesmashed the RTPSoc).$$2250 PupNetDirLookup: Name not found.$$2251 PupNetDirLookup: Address not found.$$2252 PupNetDirLookup: No network directory lookup server responded.$$2253 PupNetDirLookup: Can't get there from here.$$2270 Grapevine: Unchanged from previous lookup.$$2271 Grapevine: RName is a group.$$2272 Grapevine: RName is an individual.$$2273 Grapevine: RName does not exist or is malformed.$$2274 Grapevine: Can't contact any R-server for registry.$$2275 Grapevine: Incorrect password.$$2276 Grapevine: RName is a member of the specified group.$$2277 Grapevine: RName is not a member of the specified group.$$2285 Grapevine: Protocol error.$$2300 Template: Too few arguments to PutTemplate. $1D arguments were actuallypassed, but escape sequences called for more.$$2301 Template: Malformed template.$$2401 The Trident disk routines have encountered an unrecoverable diskerror.  The stream that caused the error is $1O; the offending diskcommand block is $2O.$$2402 Your Trident disk is full.  You should either boot the machine,or type <control>K to kill the current program.  In any event, you shoulddelete some unneeded files before attempting any more operations.$$2403 Trident disk routines require OS version $1D or later.$$2404 Trident disk queue bug in TFSDoDiskCommand.$$2405 Attempt to create Trident file on disk with no creation ability.$$2406 Bad action $1O passed to TFSDoDiskCommand.$$2407 Attempt to access nonexistent Trident bit table page $1O.$$2408 Can't create essential file during TFSNewDisk.$$2409 Disk bit table discrepancy during TFSNewDisk.$$2410 Attempted to write on read-only Trident disk drive $2!12O.Stream = $1O; disk command block = $2O.Either turn off the read-only switch and type <control>P to proceed,or type <control>K to kill the current program.$$2411 Trident disk drive $2O appears to have stopped responding.Either rectify the condition and type <control>P to proceed,or type <control>K to kill the current program.$$2412 Unrecoverable Trident disk error on drive $2!12O.Stream = $1O; disk command block = $2O; real disk address $2!10O $2!11O;status = Header: $2!20O, Label: $2!26O, Data: $2!32O.$$2413 The Trident disk on drive $2O is full.  You should either boot themachine or type <control>K to kill the current program.  In any event, youshould delete some files before attempting any more operations.$$2500 The Diablo printer did not become ready after a reasonable waiting time.$$2501 The Diablo printer has reported an error condition.$$2600M RenameFile: insufficient free space exists in which to allocatea page-sized buffer.$$2700M Context: Stack passed to InitializeContext is too small.$$2750M Interrupt: Attempt to initialize a channel that is already in use.$$2751M Interrupt: InitializeInterrupt called with a zero interrupt mask.$$2752M Interrupt: Attempt to initialize interrupt channel 0.$$2800M CmdScan: Attempt to read past end of phrase.$$2801M CmdScan: Command delete typed.$$2802M CmdScan: Too many phrases.$$2803M CmdScan: Command too long.$$2825M Keyword: Attempt to insert a key that already exists.$$2826M Keyword: Keyword table full.$$2827M Keyword: Attempt to delete a key that doesn't exist.$$2850M CmdScanAux: GetNumber read an empty phrase.$$2851M CmdScanAux: GetNumber read a non-numeric character.$$2852M CmdScanAux: GetNumber read a number larger than 16 bits.$$2853M CmdScanAux: GetFile can't open file.$$2854M CmdScanAux: Bad confirming character to Confirm.$$2855M CmdScanAux: GetKeyword key not found.$$2856M CmdScanAux: GetKeyword key ambiguous.$$2875M CmdScanAux: ecCmdDestroy requested.$$2876M CmdScanAux: ecBackupAppend requested.$$2877M CmdScanAux: ecBackupReplace requested.$$2900 The subsystem you are running uses the new time package whichrequires OS version 14 or newer.$$

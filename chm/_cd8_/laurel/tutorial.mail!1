*start*01659 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 11:44 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: TO START YOUR TUTORIAL SESSION: Point cursor at "Display" and  click the left mouse buttonWelcome to the community of Laurel Users.  Laurel is the Alto program that serves as your mail reading, composition and filing interface to the Distributed Message System.  Since you are reading this message, you have already learned to use the "Display" command.While reading a message in this middle region you have the ability to scroll up and down as in Bravo, using the double-headed arrow cursor in the left margin. You may also notice that if you hold down the left or right mouse button in the scroll area, then continuous scrolling is performed.  If the words End of Message in italics are not visible, then there is more message to be seen, and you should scroll up to see more.When Laurel started up, it read in this mail file named Tutorial.mail.  An index of all messages in this mail file, called the Table of Contents, appears in the upper text region of the Laurel screen.  A triangular symbol at the left of the Table of Contents entry corresponding to this message indicates that it is the SELECTED message.  Invoking "Display" at the beginning of a session displays the selected message in this middle region.Another use of "Display" is very useful in reading through your mail sequentially.  If the selected message is the same as the message displayed in the middle region (as it is now) then "Display" will automatically select the next message in the Table of Contents and display that message.Try clicking the left mouse button over "Display" now.*start*01105 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 11:45 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: Displaying a selected messageClicking the left mouse button while pointing at "Display" will continue to select and display the next message if you do not make any explicit selections in the Table of Contents.  You may explicitly select any message in the Table of Contents by moving the cursor into the line selection area to the left of the Table of Contents text (as in Bravo) and clicking the left mouse button.Try explicitly selecting some messages in the Table of Contents now, but do not invoke "Display" on any of them just yet.The Table of Contents may also be scrolled up or down as in Bravo or continuously.  Scroll the Table of Contents now so that message number 1 is visible, and select that message.If you invoke "Display" now, you will display the selected message as it is not the currently displayed message.  Invoke "Display" to see how displaying an explicitly selected message works, then invoke "Display" twice more to cycle through these messages until you are reading message number 3.*start*01660 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 11:46 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: Message number 3 in Tutorial.mailA question mark next to an entry in the Table of Contents indicates that the corresponding message has not yet been seen.  You may have already noticed that "Display" automatically removes a question mark from the Table of Contents entry if one was present.These question marks are a special case of MARKS.  You may change any mark in the Table of Contents by pointing at the mark with the cursor, clicking the left mouse button, and then typing a single character.  You may even change a mark back to ? to restore its unseen status.  The best way to erase a mark is to change it to a blank.  You may play around with the marks now, but please leave the question marks on messages 4 through the end.When Laurel reads a mail file, it automatically selects and positions the Table of Contents at the first question marked entry.  This allows you to keep your place easily in your mail file between sessions of using Laurel.Command invocation in Laurel is accomplished by pointing the cursor at a command, pressing down on the left button, and releasing the button while still pointing at that command.  If you move away from a command while the button is still down, then that command will not be invoked when you release the button.  It is best to point at commands from below; placing the cursor on top of a command may not activate that command.Try moving the cursor around the screen with the left button depressed (release the button over a neutral area such as over this message text.)Invoke "Display" for the next message.*start*01352 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 11:47 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: "Delete" and "Undelete""Delete" is used to delete the currently selected message.  Invoke "Delete" now and observe its effect.This message has now been marked for deletion.  When you "Quit", or when you read a mail file, all messages marked for deletion are really deleted--there will be no way to restore them to your files.  Be careful about the messages you delete.  Laurel has another technique to deal with mail you don't want in your current mail file, namely the "Move to" command.  "Move to" will be explained in a later message.If a message has been marked for deletion, it may be restored to good health by selecting that message in the Table of Contents and invoking "Undelete".  Try "Undelete" now.Selecting a Table of Contents entry with the right mouse button extends the selected message to a range of selected messages.  Selecting a Table of Contents entry with the middle mouse button adds that message to the message already selected; selecting a Table of Contents entry with the middle mouse button while holding the SHIFT key down removes that one message from the set of messages already selected.  Try selecting a variety of messages and "Delete" and "Undelete" them.Select message 5 with the left mouse button and invoke "Display".*start*00893 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 11:48 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: Movable boundariesReading some of the previous messages may have been a bit uncomfortable due to the small size of the displayed message (middle) region.  To remedy this situation, you may adjust the boundaries to suit your needs.To move a boundary press down on the middle mouse button and move the cursor to the small box on the boundary you wish to move (keep the button down.)  Note how the box will now move with the cursor.  Move the box to the position you wish it to be in and release the button.Play around a bit with both movable boundaries until you have adjusted the screen areas to a pleasing arrangement.  Note that if you wish to cancel moving a boundary while you are moving the box around, you may do so by moving the box far to the left.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01549 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 11:49 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: ThumbingYou have already used the scrolling feature in both the displayed message region and in the Table of Contents region.  You may have noticed that Bravo style thumbing does not work.To thumb any of the Laurel text regions, use the middle mouse button on the thin black line just above the text region you wish to thumb.  This line, the thumb line, is dotted for part or all of its length.The cursor shape will change to a vertical line when the cursor points at a thumb line and the middle button is down.  If you lift up on the middle button while still in the thumb line, the text will repaint itself according to the relative position of the cursor along the length of the thumb line.  The left edge of the thumb line corresponds to the beginning of the text and the right edge corresponds to the end of the text.Try thumbing this message to various places.The dotted portion of the thumb line corresponds to the visible portion of the text at any given time.  The Table of Contents and composed message (bottom) regions contain selections in addition to text.  The start of the selection in these regions is indicated by a vertical line on the thumb line.  To normalize a selection (bring the start of the selection to the top line) position the thumbing cursor on the selection indicator on the thumb line and release the middle mouse button.  Try normalizing the Table of Contents selection now.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01994 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 11:50 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: "Mail file" and "Move to"The mail file you are now reading is named Tutorial.mail.  The default mail file that Laurel uses when you do not specify a particular mail file is named Active.mail.Laurel allows you to arrange your messages in separate batches called mail files. If you wish to move a message from the mail file you are now reading to another mail file, "Move to" will accomplish this.  When you invoke "Move to", a blinking caret will appear in the brackets next to the command.  You may now fill in these brackets with the name of a mail file.  The extension .mail will be assumed if you do not provide any periods in the name.When you have finished typing the file name, you may confirm by striking the ESC key or you may cancel the Move to command by striking DEL.  The selected message(s) will now be moved.  If the file name already in the brackets is the one you want, just strike ESC immediately.Make sure that this message is the selected message, and move it to a file named Test.  Confirm that you want this new mail file when the exception message appears below.Invoke "Undelete" to keep a copy of this message in the Tutorial.mail file.Set the mark on this message (message 7 in the Table of Contents) to ?.Now we will read the Test.mail file (it should have only one message--this one--in it).  Invoke "Mail file" and fill its brackets with Test.  When you terminate with ESC, the Tutorial.mail file will be cleaned up, deleted entries removed, and the Test.mail file will be read.  Invoke "Display" when ready to continue reading this message (from this point on) in that file.Here we are in Test.mail.  Delete this message, invoke "Mail file" with Tutorial to get back to Tutorial.mail (don't forget the ESC), "Display" this message once again, and continue reading from this point on.Now we are back in Tutorial.mail.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01679 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 12:05 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: "New mail"New mail that has been sent to you is collected in your inbox on another computer.  The "New mail" command is used to move this mail from your inbox to the mail file that you are currently reading.  The following is an explanation of how to use "New mail", but do not invoke it during this tutorial session for reasons that will become obvious as you read on.WARNING: It is very easy to bring mail to Laurel, but it is tedious to move mail back to your inbox.  If you are presently using some other mail handling program (particularly one such as Msg on Maxc), you should read Appendix D of the Laurel Manual before invoking Laurel's "New mail" command for the first time.The ordinary way to deal with new mail is as follows:1. Make sure that your current mail file is Active.mail.  You may have to invoke "Mail file" to achieve this.  (Do not do this now.)2. Invoke "New mail".  (Do not do this now.)  This may take some time, but it will append all your new mail to the end of the current mail file.3. You may read this new mail, delete some of it, move some of it to other mail files, or leave some mesages in Active.mail as a reminder to you that you have not fully acted upon them."New mail" will fail if you are not properly logged in.  To log in invoke "User" and type your name and password, terminating each with ESC.Every five minutes, Laurel checks your inbox to see if it contains any new mail.  When Laurel discovers that you have new mail it will tell you via a message posted just above the "User" command.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*02793 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 12:08 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: "Hardcopy"Laurel provides a hardcopy function that prints selected messages as formatted memos, with each message starting a new page.  Laurel uses the information in the file Laurel.Profile on your disk for various parameters affecting hardcopy. These parameters may also be filled in during any particular "Hardcopy" command. The information in Laurel.Profile is read by Laurel once at the start of each session.  Therefore, if you modify Laurel.Profile, and you wish to have Laurel notice the change, you must "Quit" from Laurel and restart (by typing Laurel to the Alto executive.)Invoke "Hardcopy" with the left button now.  Notice that the middle menu has changed to the "hardcopy submenu".  By invoking various option commands and filling in values for these options, you may tailor each batch of hardcopy to your requirements.  Make sure the the printer name listed is correct; if not, invoke the "Printer" option and fill in a proper printer name.  Invoke "Hardcopy" now, in the hardcopy submenu, to see this message as sample hardcopy output. Note that the "Cancel" comannd in the hardcopy submenu cancels the "Hardcopy" command altogether.You may select several messages to be hardcopied together.  Deleted messages will not be hardcopied.  If the amount of output will be very large, Laurel will break up the transmission of your hardcopy into batches.  This is done to be kind to your printing server and to other users of that server who will be able to print output between your batches of mail.  After the completion of the hardcopy command, a summary message will appear in the feedback region at the bottom of the screen explaining how many pages were printed in how many batches.Note:  Laurel considers the hardcopy to be printed as soon as it has been accepted by the printing server.  There may be some additional delay at the printer before your hardcopy is actually printed.For some hardcopy uses, such as archives of all messages received, the built in "Hardcopy" command may produce unsuitably bulky output.  For these uses, we recommend printing your mail file with the "Form" option in the hardcopy submenu set to the word Archive.  To accomplish this, invoke "Hardcopy" with the left mouse button to bring up the hardcopy submenu.  Invoke "Form" repeatedly with the left mouse button until the word Archive appears in the following brackets.  Notice that after the completion of a "Hardcopy" command, these brackets are reset to empty.There are many hardcopy options available.  These are explained further in the Laurel manual.If the hardcopy submenu is still visible, invoke "Cancel" now to restore the middle menu.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*03002 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 12:13 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: Composing messagesComposing messages that you wish to send is very easy in Laurel.  The lower text region contains a Bravo style editor that you will use to type in and edit your message.The Laurel editor is not an exact copy of Bravo, but is so similar that Bravo users will not need much explanation.  The main points to remember are:To start composing a message, invoke one of the four message initialization commands, "New form", "Answer", "Forward", or "Get"."New form" gives you a skeleton message with fields that should be replaced by the proper text.  Try "New form" to see its format."Answer" automatically fills in the To: field with the name(s) of the sender(s) of the currently selected message and fills in the Subject: and In-reply-to: fields. Try "Answer" to observe its effect."Forward" automatically copies the currently selected message(s) into the message body.  Try "Forward" now."Get" replaces the current text in the lower text region with the contents of a file from your disk or from a file server.  More information on file reading and writing commands will be found in a subsequent message. To see a list of available editor commands, type ?  This is considered an illegal command, so you will need to strike DEL to convince Laurel that you know what you are doing.Replacing, inserting or appending from a secondary selection works as in Bravo. The secondary selection may be in either the message you are composing or the currently displayed message.In addition, a new kind of source selection is available, called "shifted selection".  Shifted selection may be performed any time when type-in is acceptable (even into brackets!)  To make a shifted selection, hold down the SHIFT key, make your selection, then lift up the SHIFT key.  If you change your mind about the shifted selection, type a DEL before lifting up the SHIFT key.A different style of editor, called the modeless editor, is also available.  The Laurel Manual has a complete description of the standard editor and the modeless editor; we suggest you read it sometime to learn about numerous commands that are not mentioned here.Only one font is available for displaying text, Times Roman 10, which you are looking at now.  (However, considerably more flexibility is available when making hardcopy; see the description of the Font profile option in section 5.2 of the Laurel Manual, as well as the discussion of hardcopy forms in Appendix C.)You may edit the parts of the message you are composing in any order.  Be careful not to delete the blank line after the header, nor to insert any blank lines in the header.  Laurel uses this blank line as an indication that the header is finished.  You may of course insert blank lines anywhere you want farther down in the message.Try some editing on the composed message below, but do not deliver it yet.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*02056 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 12:24 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: Recipient namesTo send a message, you must know the registered names of the intended recipients.  If you are properly logged into your Alto then your registered name will appear in the brackets following the "User" command.  Anyone sending a message to you will include your recipient name in the "To" or "cc" field of that message.If you have not yet logged in properly then you can do so by selecting the "User" command and typing in your registered name followed by ESC, then typing in your password followed by ESC.A registered name has two parts separated by a period.  The second part is a registry name, and the first part is the name for someone in that registry.  A registry is simply a group of related names, usually structured along organizational or geographical lines.  At present, the following registries exist:	DLOS - Dallas, TX 	EOS - EOS, Pasadena, CA 	ES - El Segundo, CA	FX - Fuji Xerox, Japan 	HENR - Henrietta, NY 	LB - Leesburg, VA 	PA - Palo Alto, CA 	RX - Rank Xerox, England 	STHQ - Corporate Headquarters, Stamford, CT 	WBST - Webster, NY 	XRCC - Xerox Research Center, Toronto, CanadaMany messages are sent to recipients in the same registry as the sender.  Laurel allows you to omit the registry name for recipients who are in your registry, just as you may omit an area code when telephoning your neighbor across the street.  For example, someone in the registry for the Palo Alto area, say "Someone.PA", could send a message with the following acceptable message header:	Subject: Demonstration of recipient naming	To: Person1, Person2	cc: Person3, FarAwayPerson1.ESLaurel assumes that names that lack registries are in the sender's registry, which in this case is PA.  Since "FarAwayPerson1.ES" explicitly includes a registry,  ES rather than PA is used by Laurel.  Thus, in this case the message will go to Person1.PA, Person2.PA, Person3.PA, and FarAwayPerson1.ES.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01429 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 12:34 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: "Deliver"Invoking "Deliver" will send the composed message to all the recipients named in the "To" and "cc" fields of the header. Each recipient will receive only one copy of the message, even if his or her name appears more than once."Deliver" appears only after you have edited an initial form or after you have edited a message that has already been sent.  This feature should help prevent you from sending duplicate messages.Try "New Form", fill in your own name in the To: field, be sure to delete the cc: line if you won't be using it, replace Subject with the words "My first message", replace Message with an appropriately witty saying, and invoke "Deliver".  When the word "delivered" appears in place of "Deliver", the message has been deposited in your inbox.Later, when you invoke "New mail" (wait until your current mail file is Active.mail) you will see the message that you just sent.You may cancel a delivery that is in progress by striking DEL.  If the delivery is canceled, none of the recipients will receive the message, and you will be notified of this fact in the feedback region at the bottom of the screen.  If instead you see the word "delivered" replace the command "Deliver", then your DEL was too late, and the message will be delivered to the recipients.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01914 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 12:37 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: Public distribution listsThe mail system provides a way to address messages to groups of recipients.  Each registry includes some recipient names whose first part ends with the character "^".  Such names identify groups rather than individuals.  Using such a name as the recipient of a message causes the message to go to all the individuals included in the group.  For example, the "To" line:     To: CSL^.PAwill cause the message to be delivered to all of the approximately 75 recipients in the Computer Science Laboratory of the Palo Alto Research Center.While you are able to send to any public distribution list in any registry, you should think very carefully about your choice of message and list so as not to bother recipients with messages they don't care to read.  Check with experienced users to find out which lists should be used for which kinds of messages.The public distribution lists for each registry are stored in a distributed data base system called Grapevine, which knows about all registered names and is also responsible for mail transport.  The membership of a list can be altered by that list's owners.  You can have your name added to a list by sending a message to the list's owners, who may be addressed as "Owners-X" where X is the name of the distribution list.  There are some lists to which you may add your own name without interacting with the list's owner.  Changing distribution lists is done by running the Maintain program, described in Appendix B.2 of the Laurel Manual.An index of all the public distribution lists in Grapevine is contained in the file <Laurel>DLMap.txt, stored on the file server from which you obtained Laurel.  You may examine it by invoking Laurel's "Get" command, which will be described in a later message.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01895 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 12:56 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: Private distribution listsLaurel also provides a way for you to create private distribution lists.  A private distribution list is simply a file containing a list of registered names separated by commas, just as they would appear in the header of a message.  You can create such a file using the Laurel editor or another editor such as Bravo.Suppose you have such a private distribution list in a file on your machine's disk named, say, "MyFriends.dl".  To address a message to the members of this list, you may specify:     To: MyFriends.dl: ;in the header of the message (that is, the name of the file followed by a colon and then a semicolon).  Laurel will read the file as part of the "Deliver" operation and include all names found in the file as recipients for the message.You should understand that in general the recipients of such a message won't know who the other recipients were, since the contents of the distribution list are private.  If you wish to make the membership of the list visible, you may "expand" the list before delivering the message.  To do this, select the space between the colon and the semicolon, invoke the "G" keyboard command (COM-G in the modeless editor), fill in the "File" brackets with the name of the file (shifted selection is useful here), and strike ESC.  The result will be something like:     To: MyFriends.dl: Jones.PA, Smith.ES, Doe.WBST;It is also possible to use files stored on file servers as private distribution lists.  Remotely stored private distribution lists are useful if a group of people want to share the use of the list.  The syntax for naming such a list is:     "[server]<directory>filename.extension": ;Note that it is necessary to put double quotes around the entire file name.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*03958 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 13:14 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: "Get", "Put" and "Copy"Laurel provides several commands that read and write files on your local disk or on file servers.  These are the "Get", "Put" and "Copy" commands located in the lower menu and the G and P commands accepted by the editor in the lower text area.  All these commands require that a file name be specified; brackets will appear in a second line of the lower menu for this purpose.  The syntax for naming local files is "filename.extension"; for remote files it is "[server]<directory>filename.extension".  (Note that when you are typing a file name into brackets, you should not enclose it in double quotes.)Try the "Get" command now.  Invoke "Get" with the left mouse button, then type the name of a small text file into the brackets (Laurel.Profile will do nicely).  Terminate the file name with ESC.  If previous editing has left you in a state where Laurel requests you to confirm, do so.The message in the lower composition window has been replaced by your text file.  Do not edit it now.Now try the "Put" command.  Invoke "Put" with the left mouse button.  Now that the caret is blinking in the brackets, you may type a new file name terminated by ESC, or else just ESC which will confirm the name already in the brackets.  Strike ESC now.  Laurel will notify you that it will overwrite the file since it already exists on your disk.  Laurel differs from Bravo here in that Laurel will not create a backup file, but will overwrite the existing file.  At this point you may confirm or cancel this command.  For now, confirm with ESC.With "Get" and "Put", Laurel provides a simple text editor that may be used for numerous simple text editing tasks.  Some typical uses of "Get" and "Put" are:1) Saving a composed message that couldn't be delivered due to network    problems.2) Creation of standard message forms or "boilerplate" for command files.  The    recommended method for creation of customized message forms is to start with    a "New form", edit it, and "Put" it on some easily remembered file.  The "Get"    command will add .form to any file name not containing a period, so storing    message forms on files with extension .form is recommended.The G and P editor commands are similar to "Get" and "Put", but they work on the selected text rather than the entire composed message.The G editor command has the effect of replacing the selected text by the contents of a file.To try the G editor command do the following.  Invoke "New form" now.  Select the Message placeholder.  Type G, then type Laurel.profile followed by ESC.  Notice that the Message placeholder, which was formerly selected, has now been replaced by the contents of your Laurel.profile.The P editor command will write the text selection on a named file.  ESC to confirm the existing file name or typein to begin a new file name works as usual.Get and G will also work on public distribution lists.  Simply type the name of the distribution list into the brackets, complete with "^".  Getting a public distribution list is a good way to find out the membership of that list.The "Copy" command copies the contents of one file to another file.  The source and destination files may each be either on your local disk or on a remote file server.  The copying is done without involving the editor region of Laurel, so the contents of the composition area are not modified.  When you invoke the "Copy" command, two sets of brackets appear in the second line of the lower menu, labelled "from" and "to".  You fill in each of these brackets in turn, using remote file names (as with "Get") when you wish to specify a remote file, and local names when you wish to specify a local file.There is no C editor command, as copying a file does not involve the message in your composition region in any way.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01823 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 13:24 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: Running programsThe "Run" command in the lower menu allows you to run programs while still inside Laurel.  A number of standard Laurel runnable programs are available on your local file server in the <Laurel> directory.  These programs are generally named with a .laurel extension.If you have one of these programs on your disk, you may run it by invoking the "Run" command and filling in the brackets that appear in the second line of the lower menu with the name of the program.  You may omit the extension in the program's name if it is .laurel.  Most programs that run in Laurel use the lower window as a typescript.  If the program expects typed input, you may type normally or use shifted selection as described in Message number 10.  After the program has finished, the typescript remains in the composition window, where you may do with it what you wish (edit, store in a file with the Put command, etc.)You may run a program that is not on your disk at the time you invoke the "Run" command.  Just specify the complete remote filename, such as [server]<Laurel>filename.laurel.  The program will first be copied to your local disk and then will be loaded and run.One very valuable program that you may wish to run is Chat.laurel.  This program provides Chat service in the lower window of Laurel for talking to file servers, Maxc, etc.  Another important program is Maintain.laurel, which enables you to perform operations on the Grapevine data base such as change your password, examine or alter the membership of distribution lists, and a number of others.Appendix B of the Laurel Manual contains descriptions of several programs that are available for the "Run" command.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01977 00024 UU Date: Sun, 5 Jun 83 13:32 PDTFrom: LaurelSupport.PASubject: We're doneMuch more information about Laurel can be found in the Laurel Manual, available as <Laurel>Laurel.press on your favorite file server.  We recommend that you read this manual soon to find out about many things that could not be included in this brief tutorial.Laurel has changed since the Laurel Manual was last revised.  The current version is Laurel 6.1, whereas the version described in the manual is Laurel 6.  In particular, conventions for private distribution lists and for ARPA recipient names are quite different; also, there is an expanded set of programs that may be invoked by the Run command.There is a documentation file, <Laurel>Laurel61.mail, which describes the changes in Laurel 6.1.  It is stored on the same server from which you obtained Laurel.  It is organized as a Laurel mail file so that you can peruse it on-line just as you can this tutorial.  To access it, first use Laurel's "Copy" command to copy [server]<Laurel>Laurel61.mail to Laurel61.mail on your local disk.  Then invoke the "Mail file" command, fill in the name Laurel61, and strike ESC.Any comments you have about the operation of Laurel or about this tutorial should be sent to LaurelSupport.PA.To leave Laurel, just invoke "Quit".  A confirmation (ESC) will be necessary.  Be sure that you have not deleted some precious message, as any deleted messages will be forgotten forever.If you wish to move some of the previous messages to your Active file, you may do so now by selecting those messages and invoking "Move to" with Active for the file name in the brackets.  Messages 8, 10, and 12 are particularly relevant, as they contain information about actions that you were requested not to perform while you read through this tutorial.  Once you have moved these messages to Active, you may invoke "Mail file" on Active and you will have become a real Laurel user.Good luck!

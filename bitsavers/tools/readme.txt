aar will print out a directory of an Alto disk image

tdisk is the disk imager. The original version worked one bit at a time
out the Alto II utility port. I modified it to run 4 and 8 bits at a time
into a PC parallel port. The MacOS 9 version of the PC side is also there. The
code is ugly, most of it is code to probe the PCI bus to find the parallel port
card.

There was never a program written to take a disk image and copy it back to a
real Alto disk pack.
